The company plans to open its first grocery store in Los Angeles as early as the end of the year, one person said. Amazon has already signed leases for at least two other grocery locations with openings planned for early next year, this person said.
The new stores would be distinct from the companyâ€™s upscale Whole Foods Market brand, though it is unclear whether the new grocery chain would carry the Amazon name.
Amazon is also exploring an acquisition strategy to widen the new supermarket brand by purchasing regional grocery chains with about a dozen stores under operation, one person said.
