The share of people 12 and over using Facebook was 67% in 2017, but declined to 62% in 2018 and 61% this year.The slump was most pronounced among kids and younger adults, with usage plummeting 17% among those aged 12 to 34 over the past two years. In contrast, usage dropped just 3 percentage points among people aged 35 to 54, and actually increased by 4 points among people 55 and up.An estimated 172 million people remain on the beleaguered site today, according to the \u201cInfinite Dial\u201d telephone survey of 1,500 people aged 12 and up.A Facebook FB, +0.23%  spokeswoman declined to comment on the study.See also: Want to delete Facebook?

CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday pledged to build a \u201cprivacy-focused\u201d platform going forward, grounded in principles like private interactions, encryption, secure data storage and safety.Despite the heightened focus on privacy, users\u2019 primary motivation for ditching the site appears to be their own happiness. Market-research firm Datatrek Research found last year that Google searches for \u201cdelete Facebook\u201d were 97% correlated with searches for terms like \u201cbeing happy\u201d and \u201cquotes about being happy.\u201dTeens and tweens have migrated to Snapchat SNAP, -1.15%   and Instagram for their visual content, a 2017 eMarketer analysis suggested, while many kids coming into their tweens are skipping Facebook entirely.

They have also captured business as some traditional rivals close locations.Target has been adding private brands, renovating hundreds of locations and using its stores to fulfill online orders. For the quarter ended Feb. 2, comparable sales increased 5.3%, boosted by a 31% jump in online orders.\"It's clear our strategy is working,\" said Chief Executive Brian Cornell in an investor meeting on Tuesday. He said Target expects to increase traffic and grab more share in 2019.Kohl's has been working closely with Amazon.com Inc. to both sell Amazon products such as Echo devices in its stores and process returns for merchandise bought on the online retailer. On Tuesday, it said it would expand the sale of Amazon products to about 200 stores, up from 30 currently.

Kohl's, however, warned that sales were off to a slow start in February, mainly due to adverse weather.Shares of Target gained 4%, while Kohl's rose nearly 6%. Both stocks are little changed from where they were trading a year ago.Their reports follow a mixed holiday quarter for U.S. retailers, despite a strong U.S. economy and healthy consumer spending. Chains like Walmart Inc. and Best Buy Co. posted gains, while department stores like J.C. Penney Co. and Sears Holdings Corp. struggled.Like Walmart, Target and Kohl's said they both benefited from closures at Toys \"R\" Us and other retailers last year and added that they plan to continue taking share from struggling rivals. \"Those who don't have the resources to evolve are being left behind,\" said Target finance chief Cathy Smith.In 2018, Target opened more smaller stores in cities and remodeled more than 300 locations. It plans to remodel another 300 this year. The company has also been training store workers to develop expertise in categories like beauty and food.Target and Kohl's have also shifted their focus toward growing online, offering more options to receive web orders at home or pick up in stores. Target said that nearly three-quarters of its fourth-quarter digital sales were fulfilled by stores. At Kohl's, the figure was 40%.Digital channels generated more than 10% of Target's sales during the quarter. \"It wasn't long ago that digital was a rounding error,\" Mr. Cornell said. \"Digital growth at Target isn't coming at the expense of stores.\"Kohl's CEO Michelle Gass said initiatives such as an expanded assortment of activewear and the addition of mobile checkout to 150 stores helped the retailer acquire new customers in the recent quarter. The company is testing a new beauty concept in one store that features prestige brands such as Ralph Lauren and Dolce & Gabbana.Like other department stores, Kohl's has been looking to offload excess space in its stores. On Tuesday, it said it signed a deal with Planet Fitness Inc. to lease space in 10 stores to the fitness chain.After rising 5% in 2018, Target said it expects comparable sales to rise by a low- to mid-single digit percentage this year. It also set profit targets that were above Wall Street's targets.Target's fourth-quarter revenue was flat at $22.98 billion from a year ago, which had an extra week. Profit fell 27% to $799 million compared with the same quarter a year ago. The decline in profit was largely a result of taxes.After rising 1.7% in 2018, Kohl's said it expects comparable sales to be flat or rise as much as 2% this year. It also set profit targets that were above Wall Street's targets.Kohl's reported profit fell 42% in the fourth quarter to $272 million. The decline was driven by a $104 million pretax restructuring charge and a $90 million provision for taxes.For the fiscal year 2019, Kohl's expects per-share earnings of $5.80 to $6.15, above current analyst forecasts.--Kimberly Chin contributed to this article.Write to Khadeeja Safdar at khadeeja.safdar@wsj.com and Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com", "title": "Target and Kohl's gain as rivals shrink"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-rock-solid-etfs-for-an-uncertain-2019-stock-market-2019-03-12": {"article": "So far, 2019 has been pretty rosy for investors. The markets are up since Jan. 1, and Corporate America is closing out an impressive earnings season that boasted the fifth-straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.Yet while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.37%   is up by about 10% year-to-date, it's important to know the benchmarket index is back it was a year ago and remains more than 5% below its mid-2018 highs even after the recent rally.That's because many investors are viewing stocks with trepidation lately. While it's tempting to write off such negativity as the latest hysterics from chronically pessimistic perma-bears, the reality is that future U.S. market gains may be much harder to come by.For instance, the market\u2019s strong track record of earnings growth of more than 10% means this kind of expansion is now the norm. Accordingly, comps are going to get increasingly difficult now that corporate tax cuts and record highs for consumer spending are already priced in. As proof that the outlook may be dimming even if present growth is substantial, research firm FactSet noted the largest round of cuts to Wall Street analysts\u2019 earnings estimates in three years \u2014 even as it noted a more than 13% growth rate overall for S&P 500 earnings in the first quarter of 2019 so far.At the same time, there are signs that U.S. economic growth is flagging \u2014 including the lowest reading for Bloomberg's GDP tracker since the 2009 financial crisis. That echoes concerns from earlier this year voiced by the World Bank, which predicted U.S. growth to slow to 2.5% this year and as little as 1.7% next year.None of this is to say that we should all our stocks, of course. Slower growth is still growth, and even investors primarily concerned with capital preservation should have some equities in a well-rounded portfolio.Still, these warning signs may hint at the wisdom of taking a slightly more defensive tack with your holdings in 2019. If you're so inclined, here are five rock-solid defensive ETFs to consider:1.  Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV)If you want a subtle, defensive twist on large-cap equity, the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF SPLV, +0.39% is worth a look. For a low expense ratio of just 0.25%, the fund selects the 100 most attractive holdings in the benchmark index after screening for the lowest realized volatility over the last 12 months.Unsurprisingly, that means a bias towards sleepier sectors; 25% of the fund is in utilities such as Exelon Corp. EXC, +0.89%   and about 20% is in real estate stocks including Avalonbay Communities Inc. AVB, +0.49%   By contrast, the top sectors of the standard S&P 500 index include 20% in technology and 15% in healthcare. The fund also targets about 1% for each of the 100 holdings through regular rebalancing to stay diversified.There are drawbacks to this method. Tech and healthcare are long-term drivers of outperformance, so you could be left behind in a rally. And a screen for holdings with low trailing 12-month volatility could fail to account for future hiccups. But all told, this Invesco ETF is a simple and affordable way to get defensive without abandoning equities \u2014 and based on recent inflows, is among the most popular ETFs off 2019 as a result.2. Vanguard Megacap ETF (MGC)Some investors may think it foolish to think that megacap tech companies are risky just because they tend of have a big more \"wiggle\" in their share price. What could be more stable than shares of Apple, for example, a company with almost $300 billion in the bank?If you agree with this mindset, then consider the Vanguard Megacap ETF MGC, +0.42% which invests only in the biggest U.S. corporations. In a nutshell, this fund takes the top half of the S&P 500 by market capitalization, with a median market cap of $127 billion for its holdings.Unsurprisingly, that means a big helping of megabanks such as JPMorganChase JPM, -0.42%   along with Big Tech mainstays Apple AAPL, +1.07%   and Amazon.com AMZN, +0.65%  ; tech represents 22% of this ETF\u2019s total portfolio and financials another 18%.One could argue that the individual stocks on this list aren't at risk of cyclical troubles even if their industry sectors rise and fall based on economic trends. The wide moats and deep pockets of the stocks in this ETF are sure to count for something.As is typical, this Vanguard offering sports a rock-bottom cost structure with expenses of just  0.07% annually.3. FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund (QDEF)Getting a bit more sophisticated, the FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensive Index Fund QDEF, +0.35%  offers a stock-focused approach that could appeal to many low-risk investors given both its defensive bent and a focus on long-term income potential.Though a bit of a niche fund with just over $350 million in assets, this FlexShares ETF screens the U.S. stock market based on qualitative metrics such as profitability and cash flow. It then looks for stocks with above-average dividends, and a beta of less than 1.0 to indicate shares that are historically less volatile than the broad market. The fund also rebalances its portfolio quarterly to ensure proper diversification.Collectively, those tactics add up to an approach that is grounded and seeks to minimize volatility through holdings that currently include healthcare mainstay Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.48%   and megacap tech stock Microsoft MSFT, +0.97%  The fund yields 3.0% at present, and despite its more hands-on approach when compared with traditional index funds is still quite affordable at just 0.37% in expenses annually.4. iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC)What if you're not willing to sell core holdings of stocks or large-cap equity funds, and simply want to layer in a bit of protection? In that case, consider iShares MSCI Canada ETF EWC, +0.18%  . Canadian stocks are a simple and effective way to get defensive and add significant diversification to your portfolio.For starters, Canada is a developed market that doesn't carry the volatility of many regions across Latin America or Asia. While many investors may think energy and mining stocks dominate the Canadian exchange, in fact it\u2019s a vibrant financial sector that makes up the bulk of the Toronto stock exchange \u2014 and, at 40% of total assets, the bulk of this ETFs portfolio as well.That industry concentration is actually a huge appeal for defensive investors, since Canada is traditionally a conservative place for banks; during the global financial crisis its institutions remained well-capitalized and not a single one was in danger of failing or required a government bailout. A recent IMF assessment concluded that Canada\u2019s banking system is \"mature, sophisticated, and well-managed.\"Additionally, Canadian stocks offer growth potential, and this iShares ETF is up 15% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500.With a not-so-new version of NAFTA now on the books after negotiations between the U.S. and Canada last year, this is also one of the few regions in the world where there are unlikely to be any trade-related fireworks. That makes EWC a great way to get geographic diversification without the risk associated with other global markets in 2019.5. iShares Global Healthcare ETF (IXJ)Another way to add a defensive bent to your portfolio is with one of the most sure-fire sectors out there: healthcare. Consider that in 2018, healthcare became the largest employment sector in the U.S. economy, more than manufacturing and retail. Also consider that modern cures are helping people live longer; Japan and Germany, for example, have more than 20% of their population over the age of 65 according to World Bank estimates. This creates a long-term demographic tailwind for healthcare that is as close to a sure-thing as you can invest in.There are many ways to tap into this healthcare megatrend. But iShares Global Healthcare IXJ, +0.52%  embraces a low-risk approach by focusing on 100 of the biggest healthcare companies, including Pfizer PFE, +0.63%  , Swiss pharma giant Novartis AG NVS, +0.19%   and U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN, -0.92%  to ensure geographic diversification. More than 60% of the fund is invested in drug companies, but there are a host of equipment and service providers as well, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, +0.51%  .With a focus on entrenched megacap healthcare companies, it's hard to imagine a future where this ETF sees the bottom drop out. Between the power of demographics and the deep pockets of these global leaders, this iShares ETF has staying power that is incredibly appealing in this challenging market environment.

This story was republished for International Women\u2019s Day on March 8.The glass ceiling remains \u201cfirmly intact\u201d even among the uber-wealthy.That\u2019s according to recent research published in the peer-reviewed American Sociological Review. A household\u2019s 1% status \u2014 a threshold calculated here as nearly $845,000 in 2016 dollars \u2014 is \u201crarely obtained\u201d through women\u2019s income, it found. Women\u2019s income alone qualifies them for 1% status in just 5% of elite households, while women\u2019s income is \u201cnecessary\u201d to nudge a household over that threshold in just 15% of households.\u201cAlthough self-employment and higher education increase the likelihood that women will personally earn sufficient income for 1% status, marrying a man with good income prospects is still a woman\u2019s primary route to the 1% due to labor-market inequalities,\u201d study co-author Jill Yavorsky, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, told MarketWatch.Don\u2019t miss: Venture capitalists still give most of their money to white men, study findsAn even bleaker finding: This gender gap has persisted for decades. \u201cWomen have made virtually no progress in earning enough income to qualify for top-1% status since the mid- to late 1990s,\u201d Yavorsky said.The researchers used 1995 to 2016 data from the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. Their findings, Yavorsky said, point to \u201ca persistent male dominance of income resources in top-1% families.\u201d While that doesn\u2019t mean women in top-1% households are \u201cdisempowered or marginalized,\u201d she and her co-authors added, it does suggest that they don\u2019t wield as much \u201csubstantive\u201d power as their male counterparts.Also see: The gender gap starts in ninth gradeIf women\u2019s income proves relatively trivial in most elite households, then a major driver of income inequality is \u201ca small group of men\u2019s income disproportionately rising compared with all others,\u201d wrote Yavorsky and her co-authors Lisa Keister of Duke University, Yue Qian of the University of British Columbia and Michael Naud of the Ohio State University. (Consider, for example, that America\u2019s top 1% made 26.3 times as much as the other 99% in 2015.)The 10 richest people in America are all men, according to Forbes\u2019 annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans published in October.The first woman on the list, Walmart WMT, -0.16%  heiress Alice Walton, clocks in at No. 12 with a $44.9 billion net worth \u2014 trailed by Mars candy heiress Jacqueline Mars at No. 18 ($24 billion), philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs at No. 20 ($20.5 billion), widow of the late Apple AAPL, +1.06%  CEO Steve Jobs, and Fidelity Investments FNF, -0.75%  CEO Abigail Johnson at No. 28 ($17.3 billion).MacKenzie Bezos, the estranged wife of world\u2019s-richest-man Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon AMZN, +0.65% ), is poised to become the world\u2019s richest woman should she exit their divorce proceedings with half of their $139 billion fortune ($69.5 billion).Inequalities within the home also keep women behind, Yavorsky suggested. Mothers are more likely than fathers to undergo career interruptions like reduced work hours, taking a significant amount of time off or quitting a job, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center report.What\u2019s more, women spend more time on child care and housework than men do, Yavorsky pointed out, \u201cin ways that can hurt their future earnings.\u201d Yavorsky laid out three ways to help boost women\u2019s likelihood of landing top-income positions:\u2022 Provide greater access to financial capital to help women entrepreneurs start and grow their business.\u2022 Change hostile or biased cultures within male-dominated elite fields \u2014 like finance and law \u2014 \u201cthat prevent women from entering them in the first place, or push them out once they do enter them.\u201d\u2022 Promote women to more high-level leadership positions.Yavorsky and her colleagues\u2019 findings, she said, signify \u201ca broader labor-market inequality issue between men and women\u201d in which men\u2019s human capital \u2014 like education and entrepreneurship \u2014 works far more efficiently in gaining them top income.Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

The social-media star\u2019s fortune has officially hit $1 billion, several months after Forbes put her on the cover of its \u201crichest self-made women\u201d issue.The new billionaires list credits Jenner with working her fame and social-media savvy to grow Kylie Cosmetics into a $900 million business, which began selling its $29 lip kits in Ulta\u2019s ULTA, +0.08% 1,000-plus stores last year, bumping revenue 9% to an estimated $360 million. She reaches 128 million Instagram followers, and 27.6 million on Twitter. Forbes also noted that she owns all of her company, and she keeps overhead low with a small staff: There are just seven full-time and five part-time employees, and most marketing is done on social media, with her mother, Kris Jenner, also handling finance and public relations in exchange for a 10% management fee. And she has become a billionaire faster than even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was at the ripe old age of 23 when he hit the 10-figure mark.However, the \u201cself-made\u201d moniker drew backlash from critics on Tuesday, even as last summer\u2019s cover story did, with many arguing that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune.Forbes has said it defines \u201cself-made\u201d as \u201dany person who built her own fortune, and didn\u2019t inherit the money.\u201d Jenner started Kylie Cosmetics in 2015 by funding the first 15,000 lip kits with money she\u2019d made from modeling, telling Paper in February that her parents actually cut her off at 15. \u201cThe self-made thing is true,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents told me I needed to make my own money, it\u2019s time to learn how to save and spend your own money, stuff like that. What I\u2019m trying to say is, I did have a platform, but none of my money is inherited.\u201dAnd that\u2019s not so unusual for many of the world\u2019s richest, in fact. Anne Vandermay wrote in a 2018 Bloomberg column that Facebook\u2019s FB, +0.15% Zuckerberg had the opportunity to create an instant-messaging platform for his dad\u2019s dental practice when he was just 12, and Twitter TWTR, +1.35% co-founder Jack Dorsey had a programming internship at 15. \u201cToday\u2019s prototypical founding story involves an upper-middle-class childhood, early access to a computer and an elite education,\u201d she wrote \u2014 yet Zuckerberg didn\u2019t endure nearly as much backlash for being described as \u201cself-made.\u201dDon\u2019t miss: Would we mock Kylie Jenner\u2019s $900 million fortune if her name was Kyle?Overall, the Forbes 33rd annual billionaires list of the world\u2019s wealthiest featured many familiar faces, such as Amazon honcho Jeff Bezos in the top spot for the second year running with $131 billion, up $19 billion from last year, thanks to a rise in Amazon\u2019s AMZN, +0.56% stock price. Microsoft MSFT, +0.91% founder Bill Gates remained in second place with $96.5 billion, up from $90 billion last year. And while Warren Buffett\u2019s net work dropped by $1.5 billion to $82.5 billion, the Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.44% BRK.B, +0.35% magnate remained in third place, while Bernard Arnault (the richest person in Europe) took fourth place with $76 billion, and Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu rose two spots to fifth place with $64 billion.Zuckerberg, however, slipped three places to No. 8 as his fortune dropped by $8.7 billion to $62.3 billion. He wasn\u2019t alone. There are only 2,153 billionaires in the 2019 billionaires club, down from 2,208 in 2018, and their combined worth is $8.7 trillion, down from $9.1 trillion in 2018. The average net worth of this year\u2019s billionaires is $4 billion, down from $4.1 billion in 2018. That gave some billionaires a boost, though. President Donald Trump\u2019s net worth stayed flat at $3.1 billion, but he rose from 766th place to 715th, benefiting from the record number of billionaires who lost money last year.Besides Jenner, the 195 billionaire newcomers include Oracle CEO Safra Catz, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek, and Canada Goose CEO Dani Reiss.

Lyft and Uber have not responded to MarketWatch requests for comment.Carlo Garibay was a private caregiver in Silicon Valley in 2012 when he first heard of Lyft. He had a 2-year-old son and figured he could use the flexible hours. At the time, there were no more than 20 employees at Lyft, and co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer themselves interviewed potential drivers, Garibay said.\u201cZimmer interviewed me,\u201d Garibay said. \u201cAt first I thought it was very sketchy, because I found the ad on Craigslist, and it said something like, \u2018Control your hours and get paid every week,\u2019 \u201d recalled Garibay, who lives in Hercules, Calif., with his wife and now two children and drives a hybrid 2019 Acura MDX.The driver estimated he has given more than 20,000 Lyft and Uber rides (he started driving for Uber as well as Lyft in 2013). If given a chance, he would hold on to his shares, rather than cash them out, he said. \u201cI\u2019d have the shares for both companies as a security blanket long term,\u201d he said. \u201cCash on hand is easy to spend.\u201dRelated: Tesla finally launches $35,000 Model 3, and moves all sales onlineDeco Carter was a security guard in the Mission District in San Francisco in 2013 when he decided on a career change. A friend had told him about Lyft.\u201cI had never heard of a startup before,\u201d Carter said. \u201cAt the time, it wasn\u2019t a term you heard very much.\u201d He donned a suit for his interview, only to arrive at the small office that Lyft shared with another startup and see everyone there dressed in jeans and T-shirts.\u201cI didn\u2019t know if that was a company, or just some people trying to get something going,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI was like, what\u2019s going on?\u201d He and other candidates \u201cwere looking at each other, saying, \u2018Have you heard of this?\u2019 \u201dThe company gave him a giant pink mustache, a bag of candy for passengers and a phone charger, said Carter, a San Francisco resident who is regularly called a \u201cLyft legend\u201d by fellow drivers and drives a hip-hop-themed 2006 Toyota Scion XB for Lyft and Lyft alone.\u201cI\u2019d definitely go for the shares, if I had that choice, put it away for the kids,\u201d Carter said. It\u2019s paycheck-to-paycheck for his family, and Carter does not have much experience or interest in the stock market.\u201cThat\u2019s not my area at all,\u201d he said, adding that his mission is creating a \u201cfun learning atmosphere\u201d about hip-hop for his passengers to enjoy on his rides.Keith Maddock, a self-described \u201ccar guy to the core,\u201d started driving for Lyft, and shortly after for Uber, in 2013.He had worked for Credit Suisse CS, -1.13% CSGN, -1.24% in San Francisco, and enjoyed the technical aspects of his investment-banking job, but past his associate years with the bank was finding his sales role there was not something he\u2019d enjoy long term. He left his job of four years \u201cwith a nice little buffer.\u201d\u201cAfter two weeks of watching Netflix, I was bored, and thinking I\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, why not do the pink-mustache thing for a couple of weeks,\u201d meet people he would never meet otherwise, make some beer money and drive cars.At his most active, he drove 80 hours a week. \u201cIt was a lot of hustle,\u201d he said.Maddock, who lives in San Francisco, still uses the Lyft and Uber apps occasionally, but mostly to fill the gaps in his own limousine service, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a safe bet,\u201d he said of the IPO shares. Even if a driver needs the money immediately, they could hold on to half of it for a few weeks or months, sell it at a profit, and keep the other half as a long-term investment, Maddock said.Access to the IPOs for drivers would be huge \u2014 a way to get in on a hot new stock-market issue without having to be \u201ca friend of Frank,\u201d Maddock said, alluding to Frank Quattrone, the prominent Silicon Valley banker who took public Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.46% , Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, +0.23% and other heavyweights in the 1990s tech boom. Quattrone was sidelined by a conviction for obstruction of justice, later overturned, in connection with an investigation into how Credit Suisse First Boston allocated IPO shares.With so many drivers, the amount they can earn has dwindled. The hours can still be grueling. But all three Bay Area men said they appreciated what Lyft and Uber may do for some of them.\u201cIt\u2019s appreciation for people like me who put the company on the map,\u201d Carter, the former security guard, said. \u201cWe made this company.\u201dSectorWatch: Automobile manufacturers are preparing for the car-as-a-service era", "title": "Meet the \u2018O.G.\u2019 Uber and Lyft drivers who could cash in on the IPOs"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-stock-sinks-after-barclays-slashes-target-to-lowest-on-the-street-2019-03-05": {"article": "Shares of Tesla Inc.

Our call of the day from Piper Jaffray research analysts Michael Olson and Yung Kim offers up a $1 reason to keep believing in and buying the streaming giant.As you\u2019ll recall, earlier this year, the company announced it was raising subscription prices by between 13% and 15% for 58 million U.S. subscribers, boosting the cost of its most popular plan to $13 from $11.Piper surveyed 1,100 international Netflix subscribers and found 50% would be willing to pay more than $1 a month more for the service. \u201cA $1/mo increase in international ASP (average selling price) would have a dramatic effect on our 2020 estimates, all else equal,\u201d they said.\u201cWe expect Netflix will geographically stagger price hikes, suggesting international price increases are likely to take effect, in at least some international markets, in late \u201919 or 2020,\u201d said the analysts.Crunching the numbers, they say that price hike could mean 40% upside for shares to over $500 even if just half of the uplift to earnings per share went through. They reiterated an overweight rating and a $440 price target. (By the way, they also think the other 50% who said they wouldn\u2019t pay more, would probably eventually pay if push comes to shove.)Read: When investors make mistakes, this manager pounces and profitsNetflix shares closed at $363.91 on Monday, so clearly, there\u2019s some ways to go if Piper\u2019s target is at all accurate. Of course, some worry that it\u2019s taking a gamble, considering competitors like Hulu responded pretty quickly with a price cut. The analysts said they will be watching for more negative backlash from U.S. subscribers, whose numbers grew in the most recent reporting quarter, though that was before the announcement of the price hike.Netflix is a core member of the FAANG gang, which includes Facebook FB, +0.29%  , Amazon AMZN, +0.53%  , Apple AAPL, +1.16%  and Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, +1.98%  , well ahead of the pack over the last year when it comes to share gains.Opinion: How a new crop of tech IPOS may steal sentiment from FAANG stocksSome steam looks to be coming out of the market as trade euphoria fades and investors gear up for data and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who is headed to Capitol Hill. The Dow DJIA, -0.37%  is down a bit early, while both the S&P 500 SPX, +0.40%  and Nasdaq COMP, +0.61% are basically flat.

Our chart of the day comes from a batch he sent to clients laying out that case.As Bannister explains the S&P can\u2019t go much higher because it isn\u2019t going to get much help from the earnings department \u2014 the price-to-earnings ratio for companies is being capped by positive real rates and earnings are slowing sharply.\u201cThe real fed funds [rate] is 0.6%, implying an S&P 500 trailing, 12-month p/e [ratio] of 17 times,\u201d he said, adding that they see 2019 EPS of $162 plus 5% year-over year versus Wall Street expectations of around $167. Crunch all that together and he says the S&P 500 looks fully priced at around 2,750, which is equal to 17 times their EPS forecast for this year of $162.To be sure, the S&P 500 has been struggling to hit a key resistance level of 2,800, which it tapped for the first time since early November on Monday, but got slapped down.Tesla TSLA, -2.75%  is taking a hit after the SEC asked a judge to order CEO Elon Musk to be held in contempt of court over a tweet he sent in mid-February detailing production rates that drew the ire of the SEC. In true Musk fashion, he aimed to get the last word: \u201cSEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k.

And then the European Central Bank added to the pile by cutting growth forecasts, vowing to keep rates lower for longer and showering banks with more cheap loans.Back to that bull-market birthday (or fake as some would call it). It has produced some runaway hits for investors, such as those who bough into Netflix and its 6,000%-plus gain, but la less -lucrative bet for owners of Walmart WMT, -0.15% up a mere 106%.But don\u2019t even think about walking away from Walmart, says our call of the day from Robert Ross, senior analyst at Mauldin Economics. He says the retailer is in prime position to lead a hundred-billion-dollar online grocery industry and deliver \u201cmassive profits\u201d for investors who get in early enough.Rival Amazon AMZN, +0.53%  doesn\u2019t stand a chance against it, claims Ross, in a blog post. \u201cI have no doubt Walmart will be the biggest winner in this market. It all comes down to Walmart\u2019s physical footprint,\u201d he says, highlighting Amazon\u2019s 479 Whole Foods locations, versus 4,200 for the retailer some love to hate.While Walmart was late to the party when it came to selling other goods online, it was an early mover as an e-commerce grocer with in-store pickup. By the end of this year, Walmart expects to offer delivery via 800 stories, blanketing 40% of the U.S., says Ross.\u201cUnless Amazon buys another giant bricks-and-mortar retailer, it will never be able to match Walmart\u2019s store footprint,\u201d he says, offering up this chart showing just how much Americans have grown to love filling their fridge without leaving the house.Walmart is the world\u2019s third-biggest e-retailer, overtaking Apple, and helped by its strategy of buying solid players in the field, such as Jet.com, which helped boost e-commerce sales from $13.5 billion to $23.8 billion.One potential wrinkle in this bullish play is how tough it has proven in some places to make the delivery of perishable goods pay off. The U.K. is a prime example of that, as grocer/retailers Wm Morrison MRW, +0.53%  and Marks & Spencer MKS, +2.27%  have moved slowly into home deliveries via online supermarket Ocado OCDO, +0.52%\u201cIt is truly one of the worst business models in existence,\u201d because retailers just can\u2019t seem to make it profitable for them, Brittain Ladd, a food retail consultant based in the U.S., told the FT earlier this month. Another analyst noted it costs roughly 10 pounds ($13) to pick up those orders and get them to their destination, while customers pay around half of those delivery charges.And Amazon, which prides itself on free shipping for Prime members, is looking for ways to cut its own delivery costs after paying $21.7 billion in 2017 to keep its customers happy.The Dow DJIA, -0.34% S&P 500 SPX, +0.41%  and Nasdaq COMP, +0.62% are off to a weaker start.

Thus, prudent investors should pay attention to the dichotomy that is developing now.The dichotomy is the interesting contrast between smart money flows and momo (momentum) crowd money flows. Money flows represent the final actions based on various fundamental, technical, quantitative, macro and sentiment factors. For this reason, money flows represent an easy shortcut to start an analysis. Money flows are especially important if you own or want to buy popular tech stocks. Let\u2019s explore with the help of a chart.Please click here for a chart showing segmented money flows in 11 popular tech stocks. Due to the popularity of these stocks, it makes sense to look at them in addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.38% and broad-based ETFs such as S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.45% Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +0.73% and small-cap ETF IWM, +0.30% Please note the following:\u2022 The smart money prefers Intel INTC, +1.07% over AMD AMD, +1.79% In contrast, the momo crowd prefers AMD over Intel.\u2022 The smart money prefers Alibaba BABA, +0.34% over Amazon AMZN, +0.59% In contrast, the momo crowd prefers Amazon over Alibaba.\u2022 The smart money prefers Alphabet, aka Google, GOOG, +1.83% GOOGL, +2.02% over Apple AAPL, +1.13% In contrast, the momo crowd prefers Apple over Google.\u2022 Facebook FB, +0.28% and Microsoft MSFT, +0.99% have the distinction of being admired by both the smart money and momo crowds.\u2022 The smart money is mildly negative on Netflix NFLX, -0.59% perhaps because of the upcoming streaming offerings from the likes of Disney DIS, +0.14% AT&T T, +2.08% and CBS CBS, +0.68%\u2022 The momo crowd is usually positive on Tesla TSLA, -2.63% but has now turned neutral.\u2022 The momo crowd continues to stay positive on Nvidia NVDA, +1.46% but the smart money is neutral.Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.The chart also shows the relative rankings of the 11 popular tech stocks. The rankings are based on the six screens of the ZYX Change Method. Please click here to learn about the six screens.Risk-adjusted rankings are more useful for medium- and long-term positions. Non-risk-adjusted rankings are more useful for short-term or trade-around positions.A short squeeze occurs when short sellers either panic or are compelled to buy to cover shares that were previously short sold. This leads to a lot of artificial buying that is not based on fundamentals.Late last year, popular tech stocks were aggressively sold short. As the market rose this year, a short squeeze occurred. According to the algorithms at The Arora Report, the short squeeze is now over. More important than what has happened is what may happen in the future. This is where the data shown on the chart comes in. Under the short-squeeze column is the positioning for further short squeezes if the market continues to rise. For example, AMD short-squeeze flows are extremely positive but they are neutral in Intel. This means that on even slightly good news, AMD can experience a significant spike up because of the short squeeze. In contrast, there is no such potential artificial buying ahead in Intel.Based on the data shown, with the exception of nimble very short-term traders, investors may want to slow new buying in popular tech stocks and wait for a pullback.Consider continuing to hold long-term core positions.

President Trump mentioned nationwide paid family leave during his State of the Union speech, though he did not offer many details, like who would pay for it or how long workers would have off. The White House website says paid family leave would \u201cprovide parents the chance to bond with their child while also promoting economic prosperity and financial stability in the household.\u201d The president has suggested this benefit numerous times, including while campaigning and during his first official address to Congress.See: These women had to crowdfund their maternity leaveBut paid family leave or a universal child care program isn\u2019t just about affordable babysitting. If pursued, the right to paid family leave \u2014 or in Warren\u2019s case, a universal child care program \u2014 could have a substantial impact on women and their retirements. Paid family leave could afford workers the opportunity to continue earning an income while also taking care of loved ones. Women in particular are taking on these responsibilities during critical points in their employment, said Amy Matsui, director of income security and senior counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. They leave the workforce \u2014 temporarily or, sometimes, permanently \u2014 after having or adopting a child, and that usually occurs toward the beginning of their careers. Such a move could cut their potential earnings growth drastically.That\u2019s not the only time women leave the workforce, though, and that\u2019s why Trump\u2019s proposal for family leave should extend beyond child care, Matsui said. Women, who are more often the family caregiver, also leave the workforce when their spouse, parent or another family member falls ill. \u201cThat can hit them at the peak of their career when earning the most, and when they\u2019re supposed to be stocking away for retirement and making up for lost opportunities earlier in their career,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take that into account, you\u2019re missing an enormous part of the picture, because so many people will need that kind of leave through the course of their lives.\u201dWomen face many hurdles to comfortably live in retirement. They typically earn less than men in their respective fields, and are more likely to exit the workforce to care for loved ones. An exit, either temporary or permanent, not only reduces their earnings potential, but also lowers their Social Security benefits or accumulation of retirement savings.Women are 80% more likely than men to be poor at retirement age, according to the National Institute on Retirement Security.Only five states and the District of Columbia offer paid family leave, and just 15% of private industry, state and local government workers have access to the benefit, as of March 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The particulars of these policies vary with the amount of time offered or the percentage of the wages workers get during their time off, according to the Society for Human Resource Management. Federal regulations, under the Family Medical Leave Act, require new parents have up to 12 weeks off, but do not mandate employers pay for that leave.Don\u2019t miss: Caring for an ailing family member can be a thankless act of love. Here\u2019s how to avoid burnoutSome U.S. companies are stepping up to offer employees paid family leave. Microsoft MSFT, +0.94%  IBM IBM, +0.75%  Facebook FB, +0.25%  Netflix NFLX, -0.68%  American Express AXP, +1.07%  and Etsy ETSY, +1.20%  offer a minimum of 12 weeks paid parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child. Etsy gives new parents up to 26 weeks of paid leave to use within the two years following the birth or adoption of a child.There are a significant number of Americans \u2014 43.5 million \u2014 who provide informal but regular care for an older adult, including a spouse or relative, without pay.Legislators have put this benefit at the forefront of Congress. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, introduced the FAMILY Act in 2017, which would create a universal family and medical leave insurance program for new parents and caregivers alike. The proposal has had bipartisan support, with 68% of Democrats, 61% of Independents and 60% of Republicans in favor of it, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, introduced another bill, called the Child Care for Working Families Act, also in 2017, which would assist parents in finding affordable child care. \u201cAs a working mom of a 3-year-old and with another baby on the way, I know firsthand the challenges working parents face, and I\u2019m not alone,\u201d wrote Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, who has since welcomed her second child, making her the first senator to give birth while in office. \u201cMillions of women and men across America struggle each day to balance the demands of their careers and loved ones.\u201dThe inability to find affordable child care is another reason women stay out of the workforce, and why their retirements may be at risk, said Nari Rhee, director of the Retirement Security Program at UC Berkeley. \u201cWe need essentially cradle-to-retirement policies that help families and women be able to preserve and build assets,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to provide a way for them to stay in the labor force instead of being forced out because they can\u2019t afford to take time off.\u201dAlso see: Why planning for retirement is harder for womenSome proposals would be more harmful than helpful for women and their retirements, experts said. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, suggested the country provide paid family leave in return for giving up Social Security benefits. The proposal, called the Economic Security for New Parents Act, would allow parents leave of at least two months, equating to a 3-to-6 month delay in receiving Social Security benefits. \u201cIt asks people to undermine their own retirement security,\u201d Matsui said. \u201cFor women especially, they already run such significant risks for retirement, it really is the worst of both worlds.\u201dOf 41 developed countries, including Austria, Italy, Mexico, the U.K. and Turkey, the United States is the only country that does not require paid leave, according to the Pew Research Center. Estonia tops the list for this benefit, with 87 weeks of paid leave.American women are also the sole or primary breadwinner in 40% of all U.S. families with children, which means any unpaid time off significantly impacts household spending. Only a quarter of American workers say they took time off within the last two years of giving birth to or adopting a child, another Pew Research Center report found, and many others said they wish they could. A majority (69%) said they couldn\u2019t afford to lose more wages or salary, and 47% said they were afraid they\u2019d lose their jobs.", "title": "Why paid family leave is about more than taking care of babies"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ycd-wins-first-prize-at-digital-signage-awards-with-amazons-understory-at-the-spheres-project-and-selected-finalist-at-apex-awards-with-the-amazon-project-2019-03-05": {"article": "NEW YORK, March 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- YCD Multimedia, the leading global provider of advanced digital signage solution announced today the company winning of the prestigious Digital Signage award in corporate communications category, as well as selected as a finalist at the APEX awards in Experiential category.Both awards are given to outstanding digital signage projects, chosen by an independent panel of industry professionals.

Robert Lighthizer and President Trump\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen. All spoke on Wednesday.Democratic and Republican politicians seem to live in two different universes. In contrast, most investors live in only one. Politicians use words, and words are free; investors have their own money at stake.At Powell\u2019s Humphrey-Hawkins hearing, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California, called Trump\u2019s tax reform a scam and the budget a cruel proposal to harm millions of families. Republicans, in contrast, said the economy is doing great and would do even better. At Cohen\u2019s testimony, he called Trump a con man, a liar and a racist. Democrats agreed, while Republicans called Cohen a fake witness. Lighthizer\u2019s testimony, on the other hand, was nowhere as bullish as Trump has been on the potential China trade deal. Democrats tried their best to put a negative slant on it, whereas Republicans were favorable even to a soft deal that may not be good for the U.S.If you believe Republican politicians, consider backing up the truck and buying stocks. If you believe Democratic politicians, you might want to sell stocks.Read: Tax scammers are looking for you \u2014 here\u2019s how to avoid themWho is right? What should you do now? Well, what about ignoring the opinions of politicians and focusing on undeniable facts? Let\u2019s explore the issue with the help of a chart.Please click here for a chart of S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.44% dating to 1994. Please note the following:\u2022 The chart shows that the price trend is still positive. I have learned from my 30-plus years in the markets that the price trend is to be respected, regardless of anything else. This is a huge positive for the bulls.\u2022 Even though the trend is positive, it is overextended and long in the tooth. This is a positive for the bears.\u2022 RSI (relative strength index) shows a divergence after reaching almost 100 twice during this bull run. (The maximum is 100.) The divergence shown on the chart is a negative for the bulls.\u2022 Volume is relatively low during the rallies. This is a negative for the bulls.\u2022 Earnings are the single best determinate for the stock market in the long term. Earnings momentum is slowing. This is negative for the bulls.\u2022 There are lagging economic indicators, and there are leading economic indicators. At The Arora Report we monitor leading economic indicators from 23 countries. Leading economic indicators are deteriorating not only in the United States but across the globe. This is a negative for the bulls.\u2022 Are you concerned about the U.S.\u2019s $22 trillion federal debt and the trillion-dollar-plus deficit? Start worrying more because governments across the world are awash in debt. This is a negative for the bulls.\u2022 Would you believe there is a bigger problem than the debt incurred by the governments? It is the huge amounts that corporations have borrowed. This is a negative for the bulls.\u2022 The market is controlled by the momo (momentum) crowd. This is a huge positive for the bulls because the momo crowd is usually buying, ignoring everything else.\u2022 Mom-and-pop investors have been brainwashed into believing that every month they need to send money into the stock market and somehow they are entitled to making huge profits. This is a huge positive for the bulls. Please see \u201cInvestors are forgetting that the stock market owes them nothing.\u201d\u2022 Interest rates are relatively low. This is a positive for the bulls.\u2022 Inflation is relatively low. This is positive for the bulls.\u2022 There is significant industrial and technical innovation taking place.

They will also explore the impact NTM lung disease has on a person\u2019s daily life.NTM lung disease is a serious condition characterized by constant coughing, feeling tired and being short of breath.If ignored, these symptoms can worsen and permanent damage to the lungs can occur. While we all come into contact with NTM bacteria in our daily lives, NTM lung disease disproportionally affects people with pre-existing lung conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis and asthma. NTM lung disease is often misdiagnosed or overlooked because the symptoms of NTM lung disease are very similar to the symptoms experienced by people with these other lung conditions.To learn more about the event and tune in to the conversation, visit the COPD Foundation\u2019s Facebook page here.

And to achieve the same sense of tribe a Tough Mudder event inspires, they created a private Facebook group where the Tough Mudder spirit can come to life \u2014 just as it does on the course.The training program created by McIntyre is called TOUGH MUDDER T-MINUS 30, and it's designed to achieve substantial strength and weight-loss results by applying the same strategy that prepares a participant for a Tough Mudder obstacle course event in 30 days.McIntyre's style makes it feel like you're right there in the room, following the real-time workouts day by day with the cast, but it's the cohesive support you get from the Facebook group that provides you with the accountability you need to see the program through \u2013 the kind of motivation you won't normally find in a brick-and-mortar gym.\"Being in the T-MINUS 30 Facebook group with Hunter was such an awesome, motivating, and supportive experience,\" said Chris Oates, a veteran Tough Mudder ambassador. \"You can find workout programs that challenge you, but to have Hunter actually there in the group \u2013 following your work, commenting on your videos, making you want to work harder \u2013 that makes T-MINUS 30 so much more than just another workout program. Hunter is an incredible motivator \u2013 and the support you get from the group takes the experience to a whole new level.\"\"When we partnered with Tough Mudder to create this program, we wanted to do more than just stream workouts, we wanted to give the user unprecedented access to a premier trainer and create the same sense of camaraderie and teamwork that has made Tough Mudder so popular,\" said Openfit CEO, Jon Congdon. \"Instead of trying to build that portal from scratch, we opened a private group on Facebook, and the Mudder community did the rest. It was an instant success. And what's great to see is that users are organizing waves of 30-day trainings on their own. The next one is starting March 3rd.\"\"When I train, I always surround myself with a group of people because when we all challenge each other, we all work harder. And now I get to challenge so many people with this T-MINUS 30 Facebook group,\" said Tough Mudder champion and T-MINUS 30 trainer, Hunter McIntyre. \"The results and the feedback have been pretty outrageous thus far, especially when you consider these people are training at home, alone, on laptops and smartphones. But then you look at this community and you realize, it's just like Tough Mudder, nobody gets left behind. I'm excited to see the next wave of results.\"ABOUT OPENFIT: Openfit is an all-new digital streaming platform that integrates fitness, nutrition, and wellness together in one place.

How many of the economists who advocate a carbon tax op-ed ever bothered to stroll down main street in places like Wilkes-Barre, Pa.Climate change is real enough. Atmospheric temperatures are up by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since latter decades of the 19th century, and CO2 and industrial emissions are the primary culprit. How much further that goes\u2014with or without a universal carbon tax\u2014is difficult to project.What is clear is that we are not headed for an economic Armageddon.Assuming a high-emissions path, the U.S. economy in 2090 will be at least three times larger in real terms than it is today. With gross domestic product at $61 trillion, the annual costs imposed by higher atmospheric temperatures would be a manageable $510 billion.The latter is likely to be less but where the burdens are visited, those will be severe.Coastal floods and ferocity of storms along the East and Gulf Coasts and wild fires in the West are already escalating but insurance companies, with armies of climatologists, are having fits trying to model where and how much further their risks will increase.At the same time, fresh water supplies are becoming more valuable and the target of speculative investors, like the Harvard endowment, and agricultural land in Canada\u2019s Prairie Provinces more productive and valuable.Mitigation\u2014building sea walls in cities like New York and tougher building codes in Texas\u2014and relocating populations from many high-risk areas will be less expensive than a carbon tax, because the tax would have to escalate to draconian levels and impose unconscionable risks to accomplish the Paris Agreement\u2019s objectives.To substantially reduce the trajectory of carbon emissions globally, about 100 trillion kilowatt hours of electrical generating capacity\u2014about 3.3 trillion kilowatts per year over 30 years\u2014will be needed. The Merkel government in Germany has pulled out all the stops on renewables and found it can only accomplish about one-fifth its annual share\u2014and it is a highly advanced society with the best engineering expertise.A massive buildout of nuclear power would be required for a universal carbon tax to accomplish a meaningful reduction in the path of projected greenhouse gas.If Japan with its superior organization could not avoid the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, do we really want to build out a pervasive network of nuclear reactors, including places like Venezuela and the Sudan?China, which is the largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions, has reversed course and is building new coal-fired facilities that will almost equal total existing U.S. capacity. Provincial governments in Canada and the Yellow Jackets in France are opposing national carbon taxes of one sort or another.If the United States took the economists\u2019 advice, it would be free trade all over again\u2014America and some European nations would play by the rules while others would not. More jobs would be lost to China and other destinations in Asia.Global emissions would rise not fall as those nations generated the necessary electricity with cheap coal, and the costs to the U.S. economy of a carbon tax would far exceed the benefits.Now read: Take these 3 steps to climate-proof your stock-market investmentsWant news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

FB, +0.24% Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.66% and Alphabet\u2019s Google GOOGL, +1.90% GOOG, +1.73% have used mergers and proprietary marketplaces to limit competition.Her plan would designate any online marketplace, exchange or platform for connecting third parties that is held by a company with global revenue of at least $25 billion a year as \u201cplatform utilities,\u201d where companies would prohibiting from owning participants on that platforms, meet a standard of dealing with users and not be allowed to transfer or share data with third parties. Smaller companies would also face those same standards but wouldn\u2019t have to structurally separate, according to the Warren plan.Amazon Marketplace, Google\u2019s ad exchange, and Google Search would be platform utilities under this law.She also would appoint regulators who would unwind completed acquisitions such as Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Facebook\u2019s purchase of WhatsApp and Google\u2019s acquisition of Waze.\u201cThe steps I\u2019m proposing today will allow existing big tech companies to keep offering customer-friendly services, while promoting competition, stimulating innovation in the tech sector, and ensuring that America continues to lead the world in producing cutting-edge tech companies,\u201d Warren wrote.Shares of those three companies were all lower as the broader market struggled in wake of lower-than-expected jobs growth numbers as well as concerns over China.Warren so far has had one of the more detailed policy agendas of any of the major Democratic candidates.

Right after we got married, we chose to buy a house we saw potential for fixing up and selling when the market got better. We spent every dime we had, even selling my car to afford the minimum down payment for the house.About a year later, we found ourselves in a tough a legal/financial situation. My husband\u2019s parents stepped in and \u201cgifted\u201d us $5,000 toward the purchase of a used car. We did not ask for the money, but we willingly accepted the financial help.Since then, we have most certainly gotten back on our feet. We sold that first house we bought last summer when the market peaked and made 175% of what we purchased it for. We\u2019ve gone through several vehicles, and have made other large purchases and/or investments.I\u2019ve mentioned to my husband, on more than one occasion, that I\u2019d like to pay back his parents, but he insists it was a gift and that they don\u2019t want the money back.Recommended: The next time you go anywhere, remember the $1 tip is deadMy in-laws are financially set. My father-in-law is retiring this year, and my mother-in-law hasn\u2019t worked in about a decade because her husband makes a great salary with a lot of bonus incentives. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t need the money, but it\u2019s something that has been eating at me since the day we received it.Finances have been a tough subject between us and them since early in our relationship (surprise, surprise). There have been multiple instances where money has been the topic of arguments, either in their disapproval of our spending (like buying our first home), or paying back my husband\u2019s student loans (which they promised to help with, but did not do so in the magnitude which they said they would).They\u2019ve given us other large gifts since then, like a trip with them to Florida, a new washer/dryer, and they spoil our kids with many gifts. And while this is all appreciated, it doesn\u2019t come without expectations from us.Nearly two years ago, my in-laws picked a fight with us that included our \u201cungratefulness\u201d for all they do for us and that we should be showing more appreciation by inviting them over to see the kids more. They mentioned how they give us all these \u201clavish gifts\u201d and get no sense of appreciation from us in return. I can tell that my mother-in-law specifically uses these things as leverage.Also see: My fianc\u00e9\u2019s father is custodian of his IRA \u2014 how can I get him to relinquish control?I don\u2019t see this $5,000 gift as any different, and she will someday hold it over our heads. For the record, we offered to pay our own way to Florida, and told them not to get us the washer/dryer, but they insisted.We\u2019ve always thanked them profusely for the things they\u2019ve done for us and we gave them an open invitation to come visit the grandkids whenever they want. Since the fight two years ago, they have cut back their gifts to us substantially.My husband and I agree on our finances, and we have never had an issue between the two of us when it comes to spending/investing/saving. We are in a really good financial place right now to be able to pay back the $5,000 gift. I don\u2019t know how to pay it back or how to convince my husband that we should.I know they won\u2019t accept cash or a check. I don\u2019t know where they bank so I can\u2019t make an anonymous deposit. My husband doesn\u2019t have a great relationship with his mom and he doesn\u2019t usually talk finances with his dad.Do you have any suggestions on how we might give them money so I don\u2019t have to hear about it when my mother-in-law is on her death bed?Clear financial conscienceDear Clear financial conscience,Your in-laws sound like good people. They also sound like they can be complicated people. I would say the same is true for you and your husband too. The same is true for all of us. We all do the best we can and, try as we might, we have expectations that can be too high or simply change daily. Your in-laws clearly have expectations about how much time they should spend with their grandchildren. And you may have an idea about how much time you can spend with them, given your schedules.The problem, of course, arises when a friend or family member decides to \u201cbuy time\u201d with gifts. I call it a gift tax. Every time you accept money or a new washer/dryer, you should note that it doesn\u2019t come without strings. It doesn\u2019t make your in-laws bad people, but people don\u2019t lavish gifts on others if they don\u2019t believe there\u2019s some high status/low status dynamic to the relationship. They believe you need their help. They may have been persistent, but no one forces anyone to accept such gifts.Also see: My boyfriend and I have two kids \u2014 should I pay off his $130,000 student debt?When you sold your home, you had an opportunity to repay the $5,000 in a way that didn\u2019t offend and say, \u201cWe\u2019ve got this and we are so grateful you were there for us.\u201d However, I believe the moment to return the money without any hurt feelings has passed. Returning this $5,000 is neither the sole cause nor the solution to your problem with your in-laws. Nor is the washer/dryer, or any of the other gifts. They complicate the relationship, but it\u2019s too late to \u201cunaccept\u201d those gifts.The Moneyist Facebook Group has some other novel ways of giving back to your in-laws. Here are just a few: Use the $5,000 to take them on a vacation. Use the money to hire a family counselor, and sit down with your in-laws and tell them how much you love them, and say you want to figure out a way to spend more time together. One group member also noted your dismay that they didn\u2019t pay the amount of student loans they promised. I agree that you can\u2019t have it both ways.Don\u2019t miss: Should two people with $1 million in debt even consider getting married?Thank them for everything they\u2019ve done, tell them how much you appreciate them and how important it is to have them in your lives and the lives of your grandchildren. You may even wish to acknowledge that sometimes you are busier than you would like to be and wish you could spend more time together. Ask them how much time they would like to spend with their grandchildren. You can\u2019t reach a solution if you don\u2019t know what you want and what they want too.Formalize the relationship so you can make plans and make the time. You and your husband (and children) should all be comfortable with the arrangement. Be kind to yourself. You did the best you could at the time. Be kind to your in-laws. They\u2019re doing their best too. This is story of generosity, love and hurt feelings. Of course, it\u2019s nice when someone wants to spend time with us, but it can be overwhelming if we feel like their demands are more than we can accommodate.One more thing: There are no bad guys in this story.

And while young assassin Arya Stark (played by Maisie Williams) talks a big game about being ready to face death in the opening voice over, her brave words are played over scenes of the terrified teen running for her life.Perhaps a girl doesn\u2019t embrace \u201cvalar morghulis\u201d (aka \u201call men must die,\u201d a common quote and tagline for the show) when it\u2019s finally her turn, after all.And the other scenes and snippets of conversation teased in the just under two-minute trailer suggest that death is coming for all of the beloved (and love-to-hate) characters in the show drawn from George R.R. Martin\u2019s \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d books that have ruled HBO since 2011. And in these epic, feature-length final six episodes, which will be 90 minutes long instead of the usual 60, armies brace for battle against the White Walkers, or zombies with icy blue eyes that crossed into our heroes\u2019 homeland of Westeros in the season seven finale back in summer 2017.Don\u2019t miss: Financial mistakes may cost this \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 family the Iron Throne\u201cThey\u2019re coming.

You can catch up on HBO and its services, or Amazon Prime members can pay an extra $14.99 a month to subscribe to HBO on Amazon. And Hulu has its own HBO add-on for $14.99 a month, and you\u2019ll be able to watch each of the season eight episodes as they air there, as well. Previous seasons are also available for digital download for $2 or $3 apiece on iTunes, Google Play and Amazon Video.But the last six episodes aren\u2019t the last that viewers will hear from \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d as Martin\u2019s books have create plenty of fodder for producers to play with. Possible spinoffs include at least one confirmed prequel starring Naomi Watts. \u201cWe\u2019d be crazy not to take a shot,\u201d HBO chief Casey Bloys said at the network\u2019s Television Critics Association presentation last month.After all, it surpassed \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d as HBO\u2019s most popular series when it hit 20 million viewers in 2014, hitting 25.7 million during its season six peak, Variety reported. Last season\u2019s premiere drew a record 16.1 million total viewers (including those tuning in on TV and streaming), and it also became show\u2019s most-tweeted episode of all time with 2.4 million tweets sent during the episode.And HBO isn\u2019t afraid to invest in its crown jewel, with the lead actors reportedly getting $1.1 million per episode, and the cost of making episodes running around $6 million to $10 million.

But Maimone, whose union represents close to 9,000 Department of Defense employees worldwide, said it felt like higher-ups were \u201cpicking on\u201d employees who are invested in marijuana-related stocks.\u201cCannabis is not a problem in this country,\u201d Maimone said. \u201cWe have more of a problem with substance abuse, yet they\u2019re not going after people who own stock in companies that make opioids.\u201d Employees in his union typically make about $80,000 a year, and the employee who ran afoul of clearance rules had a few hundred dollars invested in cannabis companies, he said.Investing in cannabis-related companies kicked into high gear last year when Canada legalized recreational marijuana use, but the question of how it affects federal security clearances got renewed attention this month after a memo reportedly authored by DoD lawyers circulated on Facebook FB, +0.01%   and Reddit.The memo said that U.S. Air Force officials had \u201creceived numerous inquiries regarding the purchase of marijuana related stocks.\u201d It went on to explain that the Pentagon \u201ctreats investments in marijuana-related companies as \u2018involvement,\u2019 [in drugs] which is prohibited.\u201dIt added, \u201cOwning marijuana-related stocks is a reportable incident\u201d and DoD authorities \u201cwill determine if the \u2018involvement\u2019 raises questions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, including federal laws.\u201dBut a Department of Defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the memo is just one attorney\u2019s opinion, and does not represent the Pentagon\u2019s official stance.In fact, there is no set DoD policy on ownership of marijuana stocks, and recent news reports on the issue have \u201cincorrectly cited\u201d a policy change, a DoD spokeswoman told MarketWatch.\u201cWhile, currently, no official DoD guidance specific to financial involvement in marijuana exists, the Department continues to research the topic,\u201d said spokeswoman Lt. Col. Audricia M. Harris. \u201cAny changes will be addressed through normal policy update procedures.\u201d She added that security clearance investigators use what\u2019s called the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d when deciding whether to grant clearance. In other words, there are a number of factors that influence the decision.The questions come as the burgeoning cannabis industry is capturing the interest of investors who see an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative market. Shares in companies like, Aphria Inc. APHA, -0.92%  , Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB, +2.26%  , Cronos Group Inc., Canopy Growth Corp CGC, +3.67% WEED, +3.32%  , GW Pharmaceuticals GWPH, +1.31%  , and Tilray Inc. TLRY, +2.63%  have surged over the last year.See also: A guide to pot stocks: What you need to know to invest in cannabis companiesMeanwhile, the clash between state and federal laws has created unique legal questions. Canadian cannabis investors who visit the U.S. run the risk of a lifetime ban by border officials, and people who work at cannabis businesses in states where it\u2019s legal were advised to seek lawyers after the Trump administration rescinded an Obama-era marijuana enforcement policy.And Elon Musk, whose SpaceX does business with the federal government, has been under scrutiny since smoking marijuana during a podcast last fall, though initial reports that his security clearance was under review were later debunked. (SpaceX declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s most recent report of a security review.)Employees at the more than 30 federal agencies that require security clearances are similarly caught in the conflicting legal landscape. Anthony Kuhn, an attorney who represents people seeking security clearance, says even though there\u2019s no formal Pentagon policy prohibiting marijuana investments, he would advise clients against it.Ironically, he noted, anyone whose 401(k) includes an S&P 500 SPX, +0.44%   index fund \u2014 including federal employees who save money in the government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan \u2014 is probably already invested indirectly in the industry. S&P company Altria MO, +0.22%  , the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, owns a major stake in cannabis company Cronos CRON, +3.73%  , for example. Kuhn doesn\u2019t think owning index fund shares would represent much of a threat to someone\u2019s security clearance.But buying shares in individual cannabis companies is another matter. \u201cIf you are purposely seeking out marijuana stocks and intentionally investing in what the federal government sees as an illegal drug, you run the risk of losing your clearance,\u201d said Kuhn, who chairs the national security practice group at law firm Tully Rinckey.He represents people seeking clearance for jobs with a range of government agencies, either so they can work as full-time employees at places like the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Agency, or as subcontractors. As of 2015, some 4.3 million people in the U.S. had security clearance, according to a Congressional Research Service Report.Bill Henderson, a Leesburg, Va.-based consultant at FEDCAS, a company that helps employees navigate the clearance process, said investing in cannabis companies probably doesn\u2019t fall into the Pentagon\u2019s definition of involvement in illegal drugs. In his view, that prohibition only applies to using, buying, selling, cultivating and trafficking in drugs \u2014 not investing in them.In his experience, there\u2019s another type of investment that\u2019s much more likely to trip up security clearance applicants.\u201cThey\u2019re not too enthusiastic about ownership of foreign stocks,\u201d Henderson told MarketWatch. \u201cIn the last 10 years, foreign influence has become the second leading reason for clearance denial.\u201dAnd the No. 1 factor that stands in the way of obtaining security clearances? Financial issues including delinquent debt, failure to pay taxes, or gambling, said Henderson. People with unsound finances are considered security risks because they\u2019re vulnerable to being tempted with payoffs from enemies of the U.S., he noted.\u201cHistorically, money has been the No. 1 reason for Americans to betray their country,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cWhen we spy against other countries, they tend to be motivated by ideology.

The agency followed up with a second batch of letters in September 2017 to 21 of the influencers, reminding them of their legal obligations and requesting information about their material connections to certain companies. Since then, there's been no public action by the FTC on this front so TINA.org decided to take a closer look at the Instagram accounts of the 21 influencers.\n\nTINA.org's investigation found that 20 of the 21 influencers continue to violate federal endorsement guidelines by not clearly and conspicuously disclosing material connections -- which can range from receiving a free product to an endorsement deal -- to the brands promoted in their Instagram posts. The consumer group compiled more than 1,400 deceptive social media posts published between May 2017 and December 2018 promoting more than 500 brands. Violations vary, ranging from a complete lack of disclosure to burying #ad in the middle of a caption, making it easy to miss.\n\nThe list of influencers, which have a combined following of more than 220 million, includes popular social media personalities such as Vanessa Hudgens, Shay Mitchell, Lucy Hale, Scott Disick, and Ciara. Fashion and lifestyle blogger, Rach Parcell, posted 265 deceptive posts during the investigative timeframe - the most of anyone on the list.\n\n\"It's clear that these social media influencers do not take the FTC's regulatory guidance seriously and continue to deceptively market goods and services to their fans,\" said TINA.org Executive Director Bonnie Patten. \"It is time that the FTC takes strict enforcement action against these repeat offenders.\"\n\nTINA.org continues to urge the FTC to take action on influencer marketing, having previously alerted the agency to deceptive social media posts by the Kardashians and more recently, dozens of Ciroc influencers.\n\nTo read more about TINA.org's investigation of social media influencers, see: www.truthinadvertising.org/influencers-defy-ftc-rules-disclosure-despite-warnings/About TINA.org (truthinadvertising.org)\nTINA.org is a non-profit organization that uses investigative journalism, education, and advocacy to empower consumers to protect themselves against false advertising and deceptive marketing.Attachment(C) Copyright 2019 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

Springing it on your husband months after the wedding has the high risk of creating resentment. He obviously loves his two children as much as you love your son, so you need to tread carefully.

You may be on the same page.Also see: My boyfriend and I have two kids \u2014 should I pay off his $130,000 student debt?Stepchildren are typically not included under state inheritance laws, so it makes sense for you both to clearly state who will receive your respective estates when you die. You can set up a trust for your son for the money he will receive from your mother. You can also create a separate savings account and other investment vehicles that will go to your son in the event that you predecease him. Your husband can do the same.Don\u2019t miss: Should two people with $1 million in debt even consider getting married?For your community property, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth getting into a messy conversation about giving your son 50% and your husband\u2019s children the other half. There are three adult children and, as such, I recommend you split your community property three separate ways. By all means, ask him first what he would like to do, but my own cost benefit analysis suggests the benefit outweighs that extra 17%. You can also save more of your own money aside for your son.You want to do what makes logical sense, but avoid any hint of churlishness towards his children. An estate lawyer will be able to advise you on what most people do in these situations. As one of the members of the Moneyist Facebook Group wrote, \u201cIf the situation were reversed, would you expect your husband to make same proposal in reverse? This is like slicing an orange that is not cut by the pieces already provided naturally ...Do it before you go.\u201dTo sum up: Divide your community property three ways \u2014 and the rest is open for discussion.Do you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

A digital kitchen timer, a set of measuring spoons, a vegetable peeler. It\u2019s true our ancient kitchen tools have seen better days, but I never thought of replacing them until my husband Ken joined me in the kitchen for the first time in our long marriage.For years, he didn\u2019t know how to turn on the oven. Now he\u2019s ordering cooking gadgets.What changed?We had known for years that we were overspecialized. Ken handled all our finances, and I did all the cooking. What would happen when one of us wasn\u2019t around in body or mind?When Ken and I married in 1968, we were young and clueless. Neither of us knew anything about running a household. So, we learned by doing. Our division of labor was traditional in those pre-feminist days. He paid the bills, I did the cooking. (Also he had an M.B.A., whereas I was a French major, so there was natural selection at work.)I had never learned how to cook growing up \u2014 my mother worked full time and we had a housekeeper \u2014 so I tried to figure it out from books like the \u201cI Never Cooked Before Cookbook\u201d and the \u201cI Hate to Cook Cookbook.\u201d And I really did hate to cook. After my workday as a magazine editor, I would arrive home, make some awful looking chicken, burned hamburgers or a tuna casserole and open a can of peas while Ken watched the evening news. We ate out a lot at cheap local places. On the financial front, I entered the checks I\u2019d made out and he balanced the checkbook by hand.Cut to several decades later. Kids grown and flown. I was still alone in a somewhat bigger kitchen, making somewhat better meals. I\u2019d mastered meatloaf, salmon and variations on grilled chicken. Broccoli was my go-to vegetable. My husband, who retired from a career in real estate, was still balancing the checkbook and taking care of finances, now using Quicken.When we hit 70, mortality was a not-fun guest at our table. We had been retired for about seven years, updated our wills, left our computer passwords for each other and the kids, signed legal documents about the disposition of our bodies and assets. I kept worrying: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to use Quicken, I don\u2019t know your system for paying bills \u2014 if something happens to you, I won\u2019t know how to do anything.\u201dOne night, my husband made a modest proposal: \u201cLet\u2019s make a resolution to trade places and learn what the other does.\u201d It took four months before we actually implemented the plan. Long-term habits die hard, and we each had our own turf. Cooking was the first mountain to conquer.Our son and his wife had tried out HelloFresh and Blue Apron APRN, -1.02% subscription meal services that send you all the ingredients for several meals a week, along with detailed recipes on how to make them. We used a $40 coupon and signed up for Hello Fresh, too. We initially received three days\u2019 worth of dinners for just $30, or $5 per person per meal. Then my husband entered my world, like Dorothy waking up in Oz.I was the Wicked Witch he landed on.It wasn\u2019t easy getting used to having a neophyte in my kitchen. I wasn\u2019t a good cook, but my husband knew absolutely nothing. Some examples: What\u2019s the stove as opposed to the oven? Where is the broiler? What does it mean to mince garlic or zest a lemon? Do you peel a shallot with a vegetable peeler? (What\u2019s a shallot, anyway?) And \u2014 my favorite \u2014 what\u2019s the difference between a pot and a pan?Don\u2019t miss: All the ways a slow cooker can make your life better, and save you moneyOK, I admit I was a little impatient as we worked our way through the first few dinners. We collided with each other like Keystone Kops, had to take turns using the utensils, coped with dull knives and lack of counter space, disagreed on the meaning of a \u201cdrizzle\u201d of oil, accidentally left out ingredients.I grumbled about the prep time; always twice as much as indicated and having to thinly slice fresh herbs that were already sitting in dried form in my spice rack. But the dinners came out wonderfully, so much tastier and more varied than the boring meals I\u2019d routinely produced each week.We were amazed and were like proud parents when we produced our first meal: maple-glazed pork chops. Our second-born was sliced rib eye steak over truffled mashed potatoes. Green beans with both (these seem to be the hardy perennials of the online vegetable kingdom).We took photos of every meal and proudly sent them to our kids (a few showed up on Facebook FB, +0.30%  ). We saved time and money. I no longer had to go shopping for ingredients like tubs of sour cream that sat in the fridge until past their use-by date. We drank more wine (maybe not so great) because every meal felt special. And we actually had fun in the kitchen. As my son the foodie put it, \u201cIt\u2019s like a couple\u2019s cooking class at home.\u201dAs for my half of the bargain, the finance part: Learning to pay our bills and reconcile our bank account on Quicken was much less fun.Read: Why do 37% of older workers retire earlier than planned?First off, I had to find the checking account folder in our Quicken app. The budget categories my husband had set up to keep track of our credit card expenses seemed a little random. They couldn\u2019t be changed without messing up the whole system.There were separate categories for what seemed like the same thing. My husband\u2019s tennis membership was under \u201cRecreation\u201d while my gym and yoga were classified as \u201cExercise.\u201dThen there was the tech aspect, never my strong suit. After I\u2019d spent an hour separating our latest credit card bill into the nonintuitive categories he\u2019d set up and was ready to pay our various bills electronically, the bank app refused to send them out. Seems the interface between our Quicken account and our bank account wasn\u2019t working. Or something. My husband called the bank while I lay down with a headache.Oh, I\u2019ll master this sucker; I have to. But cooking is definitely the better role.Tonight, in honor of my birthday, my husband is flying solo in the kitchen for the first time. The Spanish chicken with chorizo smells amazing.And after I figure out the banking, I\u2019ll be ready to take on the remote control.Wendy Schuman, a contributor to Next Avenue, is a freelance writer in West Orange, N.J.This article is reprinted by permission from NextAvenue.org, \u00a9 2019 Twin Cities Public Television, Inc.

But it was 1969 and I was 11. What did I know of the world, observing this honeyed-voice guest on one of many TV variety shows I watched in the family room? \u201cIs that all there is? Is that all there is? If that\u2019s all there is, my friends, then let\u2019s keep dancing. Let\u2019s break out the booze. And have a ball.\u201dHer refrain stuck with me because I disagreed. The meaning of life surely could not be just booze and dancing (though I will occasionally make a case for the dancing).Today, at 60, I am viewing life as more finite than I have \u2014 ever. Twelve years a cancer survivor, I am realistic; I had the type of breast cancer that comes back.At my annual mammogram recently, I spilled tears of anticipation just signing in at the front desk. It was here in 2006 that a routine checkup found my cancer, without symptoms, without a hint.I was reassured when the doctor on my latest visit showed me the 360-degree views indicating there was no change and explained that I am likely to survive many more years. The deadline pushed ahead, I could breathe.Purposefulness, mindfulness, meaning \u2014 these are multimillion-dollar buzzwords for my boomer generation, worthy of conferences, webinars, guidebooks, coaches, consultants, counselors, TED Talks and keynotes, all aimed at understanding the point of it all.I am not alone in my self-questioning (an extension of the persistent impostor Syndrome, I gather) that whatever I have done or will do may never be enough. There are always those whose imprint on the world and history are infinitely larger; Antoni Gaudi\u2019s Sagrada Familia in Barcelona comes to mind, along with the indelible legacies of artists, teachers, scientists and thinkers across the globe and across time.Some may argue the quest for meaning is sheer hubris, a byproduct of the self-indulgence of privilege, at a time when millions of people work just to survive, pay bills and cover medical costs. And, for so many, the looming insecurity of retirement without a financial cushion is daunting. Purpose, perhaps, is a frivolous consideration.Still others are content with their accomplishments as well as their limits.It\u2019s not that purpose will make you delirious or pay your mortgage and your prescription refills, but I\u2019ve found that as a writer engaged in many different types of work, I am happier when I am working on projects I feel matter beyond the immediate.I\u2019m not alone. A University of Cambridge study recently found that women in all socioeconomic classes suffered less frequently from anxiety disorders if they believed their lives had meaning and purpose.Also read: 3 ways to help you find your \u2018one thing\u2019Part of my growing focus on finding purpose is about getting older.As I age, it is natural that there are more funerals I attend, more appropriate flowers I send and more Facebook comments I post saying I am sorry for your loss. Lately the fallen friends, lovers, spouses, mentors, even icons I don\u2019t know personally are often around my age. I am always doing the math. In doing so, I am trying to inject urgency into the meaning of the days of my life I have remaining \u2014 not that I am privy to my own expiration date.I lack the incandescent faith my mother and father possessed in their lives and deaths, aiming for what they always imagined to be a happy ending.My father died in 1988 in his early 60s; my mother in 2002 at 80. I believe both of them (devout Catholics for life) knew where they were going all along.The devoutly faithful have \u201ccognitive flexibility,\u201d I understand, and like prolific author C.S. Lewis, see the paradox of discomfort and pain not as punishment, but as a chance for a growth spurt in faith, and a peaceful resignation that in the end, all will be revealed.A recent study in Scientific Reports focused on genetic contributions to a person\u2019s sense of well-being, and whether that well-being was hedonistic (associated with happiness) or eudaimonic, associated with the meaning of life. The results from more than 220,000 DNA samples show a genetic correlation between the types of responses.Some people, the researchers found, are wired to find meaning in their lives. That may include me.The other night I had a dream, and in it my mother was about 50, the age she was when I turned 16. In the dream, I was the age I am now, sitting in an uncomfortable chair next to my younger mother in a crowded doctor\u2019s office waiting room. I was in line for cancer treatment.It is not new for me to dream I have cancer. Every year, I think the cancer will return silent and apocalyptic. And when I do, I worry that I have failed as a person because I have not done enough with my life, not demonstrated true purpose, not accomplished much nor inspired many.Don\u2019t miss: Why Social Security should be a major issue in the 2020 electionSure, I could glance at my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 filled with years of impressive job titles and hyperlinks, or a stack of my published books with my name on the cover and spine. I can look at the photos in my home of my three grown sons \u2014 doing well \u2014 whose lives have depended on me. I can make a rapid mental inventory of people I have mentored, influenced, hopefully helped.But is it enough? Am I enough?I know I do not have the capacity, intellect, genius or skill set to change the world on a big scale. But I do want to feel this is not all there is.Michele Weldon is emerita faculty at Northwestern University, leader with The OpEd Project, and author of several books.

And there has been an explosion in profits of companies providing such services.Still, in any industry there are winners and losers. A good way to find the winners is searching for companies that are boosting sales rapidly while maintaining pricing power.Starting with the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.64%  and the S&P 1500 Composite Index (made up of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.42% the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, +0.23%  and the S&P Small-Cap 600 Index SML, +0.02% ), we looked at companies in the information-technology services, internet software/services and packaged-software industries, as defined by FactSet, which provided the data. We then narrowed the list to U.S. companies with market capitalizations that exceed $1 billion.This left us with 99 companies. Among this group, 15 companies have increased their quarterly sales by at least 20%, while also expanding their gross profit margins. A company\u2019s gross margin is its sales, less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales. It is an indication of pricing power. A narrowing margin might mean a company has been using heavy discounting to defend its market share or as part of a push to increase sales, which cannot be sustained.The combination of rapidly increasing sales and good pricing power could provide the basis for your own research. Before considering an investment, you should take a careful look and consider whether a company\u2019s strategy will enable it to remain competitive over the next several years.This data screen excluded some well-known cloud players, such as Microsoft MSFT, +0.98% which increased fourth-quarter sales by 12% form a year earlier, while improving its gross margin to 61.64% from 61.18%. It also excluded Amazon.com AMZN, +0.68% which is categorized by FactSet as a an internet-retail company. Amazon Web Services increased fourth-quarter sales by 45% to $7.43 billion. However, this represented only 10% of the company\u2019s total sales.Here\u2019s the list, sorted by increases in quarterly sales:You can click on the companies for more information, including price ratios, other financials and news coverage.As you can see, these stocks have been on fire this year.

Ed Markey\u2019s \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d environmental proposal, as well as various social programs advanced by Democratic presidential contenders, including those who plan to make health-care reform a hallmark of their runs for the White House. Contender Kamala Harris, for instance, has had to declare, \u201cI\u2019m a progressive Democrat ... I\u2019m not a socialist.\u201d\u201cThe Democratic Party is a big tent ... most Democrats don\u2019t care as much about the labels ...,\u201d Hickenlooper responded to Scarborough. Scarborough, the former Republican congressman from Florida, pushed again, and yet again, and the candidate played up his small-business beginnings and nonprofit board work, while diverting to the climate-change initiatives that feature in his early campaign.Then came a final pitch from Scarborough: \u201cDoes capitalism work?\u201dHickenlooper\u2019s reply:He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s really not providing security and opportunity for the middle class and poor people. And I think as a country we need to step back and look at that and say, how do we get America back to the place it was, where if you worked hard enough no matter where you started on the economic ladder, you would have your own chance at the American dream?\u201dAmong Hickenlooper\u2019s competition for the Democratic nomination, Sen.

Or does your company offer an app to monitor your health?Nearly every facet of our lives can be tracked now, but they can be detrimental to your privacy. Some health apps are reevaluating their relationships with Facebook FB, +0.22%  after a Wall Street Journal report revealed they send sensitive personal details to the social media platform without users knowing, underscoring the privacy risks with such apps.At least four apps the WSJ contacted as part of its reporting cut off transmission of sensitive data to Facebook. \u201cThe apps that made the change include Flo Health Inc.\u2019s Flo Period & Ovulation Tracker and Azumio Inc.\u2019s Instant Heart Rate: HR Monitor,\u201d it reported.\u201cIt\u2019s common for developers to share information with a wide range of platforms for advertising and analytics,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman told MarketWatch. \u201cWe require the other app developers to be clear with their users about the information they are sharing with us, and we prohibit app developers from sending us sensitive data.\u201dMany fitness apps can access GPS to track a user\u2019s jogging and cycling routes and can store that data and potentially share it with third parties, marketing firms, and advertisers. They may also be able to collect and sell data on users\u2019 fitness level, heart rate, and fertility, the WSJ report showed.Facebook said it\u2019s telling the apps highlighted in coverage to stop sending it data and will work with regulators in states where there are such concerns. \u201cWe also take steps to detect and remove data that should not be shared with us. All that being said, we look forward to assisting Governor Cuomo and the relevant officials in New York State,\u201d the Facebook spokeswoman said.This kind of data could end up costing you more than your privacy if it\u2019s sold to insurance companies, said Ray Walsh, privacy expert at BestVPN.com. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can no longer deny coverage to those with preexisting conditions or charge a higher premium to people who lead more unhealthy lifestyles, but there is still a risk of policy choices being made based on this information\u201cFitness apps can deduce a lot about a person\u2019s fitness levels and wellness,\u201d he said. \u201cThat data is valuable because it could be used to ascertain whether someone is eligible for life insurance, or a risk to insurers,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this reason, fitness tracking data could, in theory, be used to allow firms to form unduly prejudiced decisions against the people that use them.\u201dHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations that require patient-doctor confidentiality do not apply to wearable devices or the data they collect, making any device or app that monitors health information risky, said Mark Weinstein, privacy advocate and founder of social media site MeWe.\u201cHere\u2019s the reality of life as a wearable device owner \u2014 there\u2019s no doctor/patient privacy or patient privacy or any privacy, for that matter,\u201d he said. \u201cMonitoring yourself with a fitness tracking app that is collecting data is like publishing your own medical autobiography online. These neat little devices are hard to resist, but I will admire fitness tracking apps from afar.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, tracking health data may not always be so reliable. In fact, bioethicists said in a January study many health apps pose potential health risks, with unreliable research to report their efficacy and little regulatory oversight.The \u201cneurotechnologies\u201d industry is worth close to $3 billion, the study published by the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine said. This includes apps that purport to diagnose mental states, improve cognition, or \u201cread\u201d one\u2019s emotional state. It suggested better oversight on such products including a working group responsible for surveying direct-to-consumer neurotechnologies, which are currently under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.\u201cWith thousands of health and wellness apps and devices, oversight is ill-suited to monitor and regulate the industry effectively,\u201d the report said.Although the revelations that health apps send data to Facebook have sparked backlash from consumer groups, such practices are perfectly legal, noted Francis Dinha, chief executive officer of privacy company of OpenVPN. Generally such practices are clearly outlined in the terms of service and privacy policies of these platforms.\u201cThis particular situation wasn\u2019t the result of a hack or external attack. Rather, it was the apps themselves sending personal information to Facebook,\u201d Dinha said.Period-tracking app Flo told Facebook when a user was having her period, according to the WSJ report. Its privacy policy alerts users that data may be shared with nine different companies, including Google GOOG, +2.01% Facebook, Twitter TWTR, +1.12% and several advertising platforms.\u201cWe take users\u2019 privacy and data security extremely seriously, which is why Flo has never sold any data point to Facebook as well as we never used sensitive data from Facebook Analytics for advertisement,\u201d Flo spokeswoman Kate Romanovskaia told MarketWatch. \u201cWe utilized Facebook Analytics tool, as many other apps do, for us to ensure our app offers the best experience for our users.\u201d\u201cWe also adhere to all legislation around data privacy and security,\u201d she added. \u201cAs a precaution, we have deleted the Facebook SDK from the app and have requested to delete all user data from Facebook Analytics. We will also be conducting a comprehensive data privacy external audit and would encourage any user with concerns to contact us via our dedicated email privacy@flo.health.\u201dBy downloading an app, however, a user often consents to their data being shared. This is the kind of fine print users should be on the lookout for, Walsh said. People should avoid using Facebook or Google accounts to connect with an app and, instead, start a new account with an email address and password, he added.Even if you feel confident that they are popular and trusted, always read their conditions closely, just as you would any form you sign in the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cStart by make sure you read the terms and conditions before hitting \u2018agree,\u2019\u201d Dinha said. \u201cOtherwise, you might be signing away your right to that data privacy without knowing it.

This move is odd because analysts in the region want to keep getting information from companies so it\u2019s not in the interest to come down hard on them, says Reuters.Those shares responded by tanking 10%, and as weak export data piled on, the Shanghai Composite finished down over 4%.Investors have been creeping back into China, after the main market there tumbled nearly 25% for 2018, far worse than the 4% drop for the S&P 500. Where it led the downturn last year, the Shanghai Composite has been outpacing a rally for global equities this year, up nearly 20% even as some worry that a protracted trade spat with the U.S. will hurt the economy.\u201cThe 20.7% decline in February exports marked the steepest fall in three-years, and while some will reference seasonal factors, this is clearly a hugely important number to prove the damage the U.S.-China trade war is having,\u201d noted Josh Mahoney, senior market analyst at IG.Of course China is piling on with stimulus and some think that will help markets there in the end. Recall that earlier this month index provider MSCI said it would lift the weighting of China-listed shares, which could bring a big influx of capital to the region. And that means more exposure for international investors, including the U.S.In a recent note, analysts at Morgan Stanley doubled down on a bullish stance on China stocks.

NIOS 8.4 adds support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and single sign-on to provide customers with an improved network security experience. This latest update is a testament to Infoblox's commitment to addressing customer needs and providing a solution that is purpose-built for their unique environments.Automation and management simplicity are crucial in today's rapidly changing business environment.  Enterprises are adopting the hybrid cloud model to increase efficiency and agility. Efficient use of the hybrid cloud requires rapid deployment of DDI services across platforms, unconstrained by the cloud vendor. NIOS 8.4 adds support for Google Cloud Platform, complementing Infoblox's current integrations with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, to give customers efficiency and choice when defining their hybrid cloud strategies. Cross-platform discovery enables Infoblox Authoritative IPAM to provide up-to-date visibility and to automate the provisioning and reclamation of IP addresses, regardless of whether you're using GCP, AWS, and/or Azure.Additionally, this latest version of NIOS breaks down the complexity of network management by implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. Customers can simply log into NIOS 8.4 via one platform improving ease-of-use without compromising network security. This ability to delegate identity management to an SSO Identity Provider application eases administrative efforts required to manage network infrastructure.New VLAN management capabilities in NIOS 8.4 further improve network efficiency and resource administration. Network administrators can group, view, and assign VLANs to Networks as well as validate assigned VLANs with VLANs discovered by Infoblox Network Insight or NetMRI. This VLAN inventory data and conflict report information can then be used to generate additional reporting. This expands the Infoblox Authoritative IPAM support to include authoritative for VLANs.\nVideo\nMommy, Where's My Photo Going?

The Alkaline Water Company expects its products be in all Whole Foods stores by the end of company's 2020 fiscal year - and as you know, Whole Foods is now owned by Amazon AMZN, +0.59%To ensure that it can satisfy the demands of its growing organic consumer base, the Alkaline Water Company has also recently announced a partnership with international flavor house The Ungerer Company. Through this partnership, the Alkaline Water Company can leverage Ungerer's cutting-edge flavor technology to develop the company's low calorie, naturally flavored A88 Infused Beverage products--including the company's forthcoming hemp-extract water.Via The Alkaline Water Company:\". . . Ungerer has taken their skills to another level and solved the impossible; they have created a great tasting flavoring to use in our hemp-extract water. This product is low in calories, high in all-natural flavors, and does not have a 'hemp' after-taste,\" concluded Mr. Wright [President and CEO of The Alkaline Water Company].\"As the second fastest growing branded water among the top 20 brands in the U.S., Alkaline88(R) provides the Alkaline Water Company with an unrivalled platform to launch its hemp-infused product line, which includes sparkling flavored hemp-infused alkaline water and hemp-infused Alkaline88(R) original.With the Company's hemp-infused beverages continuing to roll out over the course of the following weeks, the Alkaline Water Company is expected be the first national U.S. beverage company--and the first NASDAQ-listed company--to bring premium, hemp-infused alkaline water to U.S. consumers - attacking one of the biggest potential beverage categories in the coming years: CBD-infused drinks.Alkaline88(R) is already sold in over 47,500 retail locations nationwide in all 50 states, with a distribution that spans more than 150,000 stores, including 9 of the top 10 largest retailers in the entire U.S., such as Whole Foods, and two of the largest retailers in the world such as Walmart WMT, -0.15% and Krogers KR, -1.80%WalmartAs the world's largest company by revenue, Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.15% serves nearly 270 million customers a week through more than 11,700 stores across 28 countries.In 2018, the company recorded revenue of over $500 billion--and it appears that bottled water may deserve some of the credit.Via Thinknum:\"Of the 15 types of bottled water that Walmart [sells], every single one of them ranks in the top-100 products sold . . .\"While bottled sparkling, antioxidant-infused, and alkaline water products make up a significant portion of Walmart's highest consumer rated water products, Walmart's commitment to a \"Everyday low price\" (EDLP) pricing strategy has helped Sam's Choice--the Company's discounted, private labelled water brand--become its best-selling bottled water product.Thinknum continues:\". . . Sam's Choice -- Walmart's in-house brand -- takes the top four spots of [Walmart's] most-sold bottled-water products . . .\"The popularity of Sam's Choice comes as little surprise, especially considering Walmart's cost-sensitive retail culture. However, its broad appeal comes at the cost of alienating some of today's stickiest consumers--specifically those that prefer more premium, health conscious products. It's worth noting that the Alkaline Water Company's are sold in Walmart stores across the country.Amazon & Whole FoodsWith its acquisition of Whole Foods back in 2017, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, +0.59% the world's largest e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing platform as measured by revenue and market capitalization, is quickly emerging as one of the world's largest water retailers. Last January, Amazon had announced that net sales for the company had increased 31% to $232.9 billion for the full year 2018.Much like Walmart, Amazon has created its own private label bottled water in hopes of capturing the cost-sensitive consumer.Via Inc.:\". . . Amazon is selling 12 packs of 365 Everyday Value flavored sparkling water at a deep discount for Amazon Prime members . . .\"The deal highlights how Amazon is using Whole Foods . . . to go after some of the hottest brands in consumer-packaged goods . . . Whole Foods introduced 365-branded canned sparkling water in September 2017, a month after Amazon closed the acquisition.\"But while Amazon's \"365 Everyday Value\" branded water products attempts to capture market share in the same way as Walmart's Sam's Choice, it too fails to command a premium price like other national label water products.KrogerThe Kroger Co. KR, -1.80% the largest grocery chain in the United States, recently announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and 2018 fiscal year. The results were less-than-stellar.For the fourth quarter ended February 2, net earnings fell from $854 million to $259 million, a 70% decrease. Total sales fell 1.2% to $121.2 billion in 2018 compared to $122.7 billion in 2017.Despite missing analyst earnings targets, Kroger Chairman and CEO William R. McMullen believes that the company has successfully laid the groundwork to hit its 2020Restock Krogertargets.Via Supermarket News:\"The 'Restock Kroger' initiative will involve an accelerated and more data-driven effort around pricing, personalized communications with customers and a massive revamp of product assortments . . .\"One product assortment undergoing significant change happens to be beverages.Supermarket News continues:\"We've reinvented what beverage sections look like,\" said Stuart Aitkin, CEO of Kroger's 84.51\ufffd data analytics division. \"We need to make sure our stores stay relevant.\"Though clearly resource intensive, bold initiatives like 'Restock Kroger,' are key to staying in touch with today's rapidly changing consumer preferences. It's again worth noting that Kroger's also carries Alkaline88(R).CostcoCostco Wholesale Corporation COST, +1.34% the world's largest retailer after Walmart, recently reported its fiscal second quarter results. The results beat analyst expectations; net sales for the quarter increased 7.3%, to $34.63 billion from $32.28 billion last year, while net income for the quarter came in at $889 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared to $701 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, last year.Much of Costco's growth can be attributed to its Kirkland Signature private label brand--a rare example of a private label done right.Via Business Insider:\" . . . Kirkland accounted for nearly a third of all Costco's [2018] sales. Customers see the brand [Kirkland] as a blend of quality and value, and it gives shoppers a unique reason to go to Costco that other retailers can't match -- online or off.\"While Costco's Kirkland Signature brand presents a real challenge to many of today's national labels, its bottled water products sacrifice innovation for affordability--like so many of today's other private bottled water brands. But it certainly seems to work.Private Water Brands Lack 'Premium' Consumer AppealThough major retailers are investing in the growth of private label water brands like never before, it appears that \"in-house\" retailer water brands have still failed to capture the premium consumer.Via Grocery Dive:\"According to the firm's and the Food Marketing Institute's 'Power of Private Brands' report released this summer, dollar share of grocery private label in the premium (24%), value (18%) and organic (6%) segments has remained unchanged since 2015 despite shifting industry economics.\"This is largely due to the fact that private label water brands have historically focused on value over innovation. However, they may not have to create products for the premium market. The Big Box Retailers, such as Walmart and Kroger, have the added benefit of not only selling their own private-label value brands, but selling premium and innovative brands, such as the Alkaline Water Company's Alkaline88(R).Furthermore, the CBD/hemp-infused segment is expected to be one of the hottest beverage trends in the coming years, but its launch still comes with jurisdictional risk. The Big Box Retailers can let the smaller, more nimble companies - such as the Alkaline Water Company - figure it out first, and then carry their products later when it becomes more mainstream.The original post can be found here: https://mugglehead.com/bottled-water-trends-in-2019/Disclosure: Directors of Mugglehead own shares of The Alkaline Water Company Inc. and other marijuana stocks not mentioned in this release and we have been compensated by the Alkaline Water Company for news coverage.About MuggleheadMugglehead.com is a digital publisher dedicated to cannabis news, investments, culture, and science, owned by Mugglehead Media Corp.

This year he wants to address some of the \u201cbiggest social issues facing Facebook FB, +0.05%  and the internet overall.\u201d\u201cThis year my challenge is to get out and have a series of discussions on the future of technology and the internet and how that\u2019s going to affect our society,\u201d he said in a recent video discussing the challenge.The promise comes after a rocky year for the company. Facebook admitted to a massive privacy breach in April 2018, after it was revealed it shared the user data of millions of people with data-firm Cambridge Analytica. Subsequent reports on Facebook revealed how extensively the company tracks user preferences and identities like ethnicity, religion, and political affiliations.Although Zuckerberg has continued to make promises to improve the platform and rein in data-collection processes, security experts remain skeptical and the company is facing several federal probes regarding how it tracks users. Facebook did not respond to request for comment.Security researchers and privacy advocates have some suggestions on what needs to change:In recent years, and particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Zuckerberg and other Facebook representatives have been on an \u201capology tour,\u201d said Dan Goldstein, president of internet marketing firm Page 1 Solutions.\u201cZuckerberg needs to stop making bland assurances that he and his team are working on privacy, security, and content problems. Positioning tens of thousands of employees to monitor and fix problems is a start, but he\u2019s given no sense of how Facebook intends to address and overcome the serious misgivings people have developed over the past 18 months,\u201d he said.The company has repeatedly made promises to give users more control over their data, but has done little to actually make that possible, Goldstein said. In May 2018 it suspended third-party apps for accessing user data and added some settings making it clear what data is collected.Apple AAPL, +1.54%   chief executive officer Tim Cook said in January 2019 that massive data overhauls are needed to keep Americans and their data secure. He suggested a \u201cdata broker clearinghouse\u201d that would allow people to see what data is collected and request personal information be deleted.The way Facebook addresses these ongoing privacy concerns could have major effects on the rest of the world, said Goldstein. Limiting targeted ads and giving users more control over data would be steps in the right direction, he added. With more than 1.7 billion members, the company has major pull, he noted. Facebook announced 2018 fourth-quarter earnings of $16.91 billion in January, an increase from $13.73 billion in the third quarter.\u201cCreating a Facebook that respects user privacy while providing features that enable marketers to deliver targeted ads ethically will be a balancing act, but I wouldn\u2019t count Facebook out just yet as a tool that serves brands and consumers,\u201d Goldstein said.As long as Facebook is free and reportedly gleaning the bulk of its profit from selling user data, the company is unlikely to make major changes to its business model, said Ayman Hariri, chief executive officer of Vero, a social media app posed as a kind of antidote to platforms like Facebook, because it doesn\u2019t collect data or use advertisements. \u201cTheir users are their product,\u201d Hariri said.But others have noted it is possible to profit without selling user data, or at least possible to give users part of the profit. The data sold by major companies is sold for about $44 billion a year, and users get nothing in return except the free use of social-media platforms.Nearly a dozen companies have launched in recent years with the mission of allowing users to sell data directly to companies, lobbying for a kind of \u201cuniversal basic data income\u201d where people get paid for the information they generate just by being online. They include Datum and Digi.Me. Alternatively, Facebook could introduce premium paid accounts for people who don\u2019t want their data harvested by the social network.Zuckerberg noted in his recent video that he wants to work in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of users, but admitted he does not always know what that means. \u201cA user-friendly and privacy-minded Facebook would put the power back in the hands of its users,\u201d said Sean McGrath, privacy expert at BestVPN.com. He called for more transparency and better control of how our personal data is used.Some solutions are already being floated: Australia\u2019s Competition and Consumer Commission recently suggested an algorithm regulator which would have the power to request information on how Facebook\u2019s machine-learning algorithms rank content.\u201cThat would certainly be one way to go, but anyone in technology will tell you that legal regulation stifles innovation,\u201d McGrath said.Facebook\u2019s stock was up 31.8% year-to-date on Monday compared to a rise of 10.8% in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.44%  and an increase of 9.7% in the Dow Jones industrial Average DJIA, -0.26%Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

When he got a notification she had \u201cliked\u201d him on the app, he messaged her immediately.She quickly responded, \u201chey :)\u201d\u201cI was amazed she was interested in me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe looked like a model, to be honest, and when we started talking she was so friendly. It felt too good to be true.\u201dThe user, whose profile name was KellyCute 320, started sending Billy suggestive messages within minutes. She convinced him to log onto Skype MSFT, +0.93%  for a conversation that quickly became sexual.But the experience quickly took a turn: Afterwards, the woman told him she had saved pictures of their brief cyber-sex session and was going to send them to everyone he knew, messages reviewed by MarketWatch confirmed. The woman demanded that Billy \u2014 who asked MarketWatch not publish his last name \u2014 pay her $800 immediately to keep the photos under wraps.\u201cAll of a sudden she showed me all of these screenshots, and then showed me she had pulled up the Facebook FB, +0.32%  pages of my aunt, my sister, the company I work for, all these people,\u201d he said. \u201cI started to panic.\u201dBilly has spent months blaming himself for the incident, but he is far from alone. Tens of thousands of Americans fall victim to online romance-related scams each year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. In 2018, more than 21,000 romance scams were reported to the FTC, up from 8,500 in 2015. People targeted by these scams reported a median loss of $2,600n or a collective loss of $143 million in 2018.Romance-related attacks can range from scammers targeting victims they meet on dating apps for money \u2014 often claiming they will come to visit or inventing emergencies like a car breaking down or medical costs \u2014 to blackmailing attempts like the one Billy experienced.\u201cSextortion\u201d attacks like these are on the rise, according to a report from Barracuda Research, a data protection firm based in Campbell, Calif. It found 1 in 10 phishing emails were blackmail or sextortion attacks. Today, Americans are twice as likely to be targeted in a sextortion scam than in a business email attack, the report said.\u201cWe are seeing more and more of these cyber attacks that take advantage of social engineering,\u201d Asaf Cidon, vice president of content security at Barracuda Networks, said. \u201cUsually with these kinds of attacks, people want to get some type of psychological leverage against people, or a position of authority to get what they want.\u201dIn this case, the woman demanded Billy wire her $800 immediately or she would release the graphic sexual images to his family and workplace. She showed him she had already uploaded a video to YouTube GOOG, +2.00%  of their Skype session and said she and would soon start to send it around. Alarmed, he immediately signed up for an account on Xoom, a money-wiring service, while she watched through his shared screen. He sent the money that night.OKCupid declined to comment on Billy\u2019s specific case, but said the user account that initially contacted Billy is no longer live on its site. OkCupid warns users to be suspicious of anyone asking for money or requesting photographs.\u201cI had been going through a hard time and it really satisfied me to see this person who was so beautiful that seemed to be so into me,\u201d Billy said. \u201cI was going through a lot that made me make such a stupid decision.\u201dGenerally, attacks are not as direct as what Billy experienced, Cidon said. In most cases, someone will email a victim claiming to have hacked them and say they have compromising photos. In those cases, it\u2019s best to ignore the claims, which are probably false, Cidon said.\u201cIn most accounts we deal with, attackers have a threat of blackmail but they don\u2019t actually have anything \u2014 they\u2019re just trying to trick you,\u201d he said.Even if a victim knows the attackers do have compromising information like photos, Cidon suggested never paying the ransom, as the attackers may simply ask for more money as soon as they know they have you on the hook.That\u2019s what happened to Billy: After his initial payment of $800, the woman demanded $1,500 more. Billy declined. He later noticed the account he sent the money to was based in the Philippines. After sending him a series of threats, the woman stopped messaging him.He never contacted law enforcement or OkCupid because he was embarrassed and afraid the woman would retaliate. \u201cI know for a fact not everyone would make this error, but if you find the right vulnerable person, you can make a lot of money,\u201d Billy said. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this so dangerous.\u201dTinder and other dating apps have been working to crack down on fake accounts since their inception. But it\u2019s much easier for their algorithms to track and shut down bots than to weed out accounts used by real people for nefarious purposes, Cidon said.\u201cThese kinds of attacks are almost always carried out by an actual person, which makes it harder to catch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe suspect a lot of folks are falling for this \u2014 attackers don\u2019t do these things unless they work well.\u201dBilly said after months of being afraid, he\u2019s back to dating online, but he\u2019s more careful now. \u201cLooking back on it, I knew it was too good to be true,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still on the apps, but now there are likes I have gotten that I ignore because they don\u2019t look real.\u201dShares of Match Group IAC, -0.05% which owns Tinder and OkCupid, were up 16.4% so far this year compared to a 10.7% increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.25% and a 11.4% increase for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.46%Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

And last year, some Wyndham WH, +0.99%   hotels offered guests who locked up their cell phones a free copy of \u201cThe Nocturnals: The Mysterious Abductions\u201d book and a chance to win 75,000 Wyndham Rewards bonus points.See also: This airline can book you a flight using an Instagram photoFor its part, JetBlue JBLU, +0.21%   says it\u2019s doing it because \u201cwith a blank social slate, participants are able to make room for all the destinations and activities they could capture and share using the pass.\u201d Though Megan Hanna, a senior business analyst for FitSmallBusiness.com, notes that the offer also, of course, gives JetBlue free promotion and likely drives traffic to its site.That said, \u201ctravel is the perfect excuse to let go of the digital chains that tie us down to our daily routines,\u201d says Gabe Saglie, an anchor and producer at travel site Travelzoo.com. \u201cSo the idea that a hotel or an airline will make it easy to turn our devices off \u2014 and to think they\u2019ll even reward us for it \u2014 does make it enticing.\u201dAnd whatever the reasons travel companies are promoting social media or digital detoxes, they\u2019re not a bad idea. \u201cThe use of social media and having your phone with you all the time takes you away from being present in your vacation,\u201d says psychologist Elizabeth Lombardo, author of \u201cBetter Than Perfect: 7 Strategies to Crush Your Inner Critic and Create a Life You Love.\u201d \u201cThere could be times when people are so focused on getting the right picture to post that they aren\u2019t actually present and enjoying the experience itself. While it is certainly fun to get to document your vacation, it\u2019s even more important to enjoy it.\u201dAdds Erika Martinez, a psychologist at Envision Wellness, \u201cthe enjoyment of travel is based on being very present for the experience and savoring it with all your senses.\u201dAnd lest you think that scrolling Facebook while on vacation is just a side note, one study found that we spend nine hours on a week-long vacation trolling around social media. We even pick where we go on vacation because of the \u201cInstagramability\u201d of the locale, another study found. And if where we\u2019re staying doesn\u2019t look luxe or cool enough, many of us fake it on social media, by doing something like posing in front of a nicer hotel room.Lombardo says that instead of Instagramming your vaycay, you should instead \u201cfocus on taking a vacation not only from your job but also social media.\u201d Saglie adds that the benefits of doing so can be \u201cemotional, physiological, familial.\u201d To do it, Lombardo recommends leaving the phone in the hotel room when you can, and if you do take photos, \u201cpost them later when you get back home so that you don\u2019t get caught up for an hour checking out everyone else\u2019s posts.\u201d", "title": "Doing this could get you free flights on JetBlue for an entire year \u2014 but it won\u2019t be easy"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-stock-market-has-now-split-into-the-haves-and-have-nots-2019-02-28": {"article": "You might have heard analysts and investors saying the U.S. stock market is in the \u201clate innings\u201d of the bull cycle.Tom Plumb, who runs the Plumb Balanced Fund, says instead that the market is \u201cbifurcated\u201d into \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave nots.\u201d The \u201chaves\u201d are companies that \u201cgenerate tremendous free cash flow with recurring revenue streams,\u201d he said. (Free cash flow is cash flow after planned capital expenditures.)The \u201chave nots\u201d include slow growers, even if they are considered value stocks, and the cyclical companies that have been replaced \u201cas the most important movers of the markets,\u201d he said in an interview Feb. 27.He made it clear that the \u201chaves\u201d are still where investors should look for profitable investments.He also made the point that levels of high-yield, or junk, debt are increasing, while the group of \u201chaves\u201d that have dominated the S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.40%  during this long growth cycle \u2014 Microsoft MSFT, +0.90% Apple AAPL, +1.42% Amazon AMZN, +0.62% Alphabet GOOG, +2.01% GOOGL, +2.10%  and Facebook FB, +0.27% \u2014 \u201cshows debt-to-EBITDA levels of 1.57 now versus 3.9 20 years ago.\u201d EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.Together, the above companies make up about 15% of the S&P 500\u2019s market capitalization. That dramatic decline in debt to EBITDA underlines how important cash-flow generation has been to those tech giants\u2019 success. The Plumb Balanced Fund PLBBX, +1.06%  held positions in all of the above companies except for Apple and Facebook as of Dec. 31.\u201cApple is in the process of trying to establish recurring revenue streams and going form a hardware company to a software and subscriptions company. They have a long way to go, but obviously the most profitable company in the world has the potential to do it,\u201d Plumb said.He considers Alphabet (Google\u2019s holding company) and Facebook to be a \u201cduopoly,\u201d but sees greater political and regulatory risk to Facebook in a \u201cnew environment\u201d when it comes to user privacy.\u201cThey may prevail, but we are avoiding Facebook,\u201d he said. He says Alphabet \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite have the same level of political risk that Facebook has. They have the potential to be more of an international player.\u201dRead other recent interviews with successful active fund managers:\u2022 When investors make mistakes, and they always do, this manager pounces and profits\u2022 This stock picker continues to outperform by using volatility as a \u2018friend\u2019\u2022 Proof that you can outperform with the right actively managed stock fund\u2022 Two very different semiconductor stocks to hold for long-term gainsPlumb is the CEO of Wisconsin Capital Management, which has a about $180 million in assets under management.He shared his thoughts about a number of other large-cap growth stocks.Plumb spoke with MarketWatch in May, when he said he favored credit-card transaction processors, including Visa V, +1.09% Mastercard MA, +0.69% and Discover Financial Services DFS, +0.52% Here\u2019s how they performed from May 14 (the day before the previous article was published) through Feb. 26:A period of less than a year is, of course, a relatively short one for a long-term investor, but there is no question that Discover has lagged behind the others. Despite running its own card-transaction-processing business, Discover is quite different from Visa and Mastercard because it is also a bank holding company \u2014 it makes credit-card loans. Plumb said that during 2018, Discover\u2019s loan portfolio was \u201ccontinuing in high single digits, but their charge-offs [loan losses] and delinquency rates seemed to be going up.\u201d He also said Discover\u2019s profits suffered as the company paid more than it expected to merchants to accept its cards.\u201cThe dialogue in the fall was the U.S. going into recession,\u201d Plumb said. \u201cBut, now, we look at a company with an 8 or 9 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and think it is pretty darn attractive.\u201dHe is \u201cvery positive\u201d on Discover this year, because \u201ccharge-off rates are coming down again\u201d and loan growth remains \u201crobust.\u201dDiscover\u2019s shares trade for 8.1 times the consensus earnings estimate for the next 12 months, among analysts polled by FactSet. That is very low when compared with forward P/E ratios of 25.9 for Visa and 28.9 for Mastercard. But the higher valuations for Visa and Mastercard are in line with what investors expect for rapidly growing businesses that are much less capital-intensive than banks, including Discover. Here\u2019s how the three companies\u2019 forward P/E valuations have fluctuated over the past year:Plumb also remains committed to Visa and Mastercard, which are the two top holdings of the Plumb Balanced Fund PLBBX, +1.06%  and the Plumb Equity Fund PLBEX, +1.72%  The balanced fund has a five-star rating, the highest, from Morningstar, and the equity fund has a four-star rating.When asked about the potential for Visa and Mastercard to be threatened by competing transaction processors and new technology over the long term, he said that the companies, with their bank partners, \u201coffer us a limit on our liability if there is fraud or hacking. That is huge and still a significant backbone.\u201dManagers of balanced funds believe that overall risk can be reduced by having a mix of stocks and bonds in a portfolio, while not giving up very much performance potential when compared with an all-equity portfolio.Plumb said his style differs from those of many other balanced-fund managers.\u201cSome take a fair amount of risk in the fixed-income area and have value-oriented or more conservative equity strategies. Our perspective is take the volatility in your stocks rather than add risk with bonds. This means looking for growth companies, [while being] more conservative in our debt exposure than our competition.\u201dPlumb spoke about several more companies, focusing on business models that led to rapid increases in recurring revenue, with the first three tied to \u201cthe digital revolution,\u201d and the fourth a very long-term play on emerging markets:Walt Disney DIS, +0.31%  is preparing to launch its own streaming service to compete with Netflix NFLX, -0.70% It\u2019s a tall order to go toe-to-toe with the streaming pioneer, but Plumb said that after the turmoil in video-content distribution plays out, \u201ccontent will be king again and no one has more content offerings than Disney.\u201d Disney\u2019s content includes not only its own live-action and animated movies, but Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, the Star Wars franchise, ESPN and ABC.Plumb emphasized that \u201cNetflix continues to have negative cash flow.\u201d Disney\u2019s strong financial position means it can eventually \u201cbecome a meaningful player\u201d in the disruptive internet entertainment distribution industry, he said.Plumb likes PayPal PYPL, +0.32%  because it is \u201cgrowing in the high teens at the revenue line,\u201d and its cash flow \u201cequals one-third of revenue.\u201d The company\u2019s sales increased 18% during 2018. Plumb cited the company\u2019s success with Venmo and said its valuation at 32.6 times forward earnings \u201cdoesn\u2019t reflect the size and potential for the digital and mobile peer-to-peer and peer-to-business marketplace.\u201dAdobe ADBE, +0.75%  has been making a very successful transition to subscription revenue from the old packaged-software distribution model. The company\u2019s total sales increased 23% in 2018, while its subscription sales were up 29%. Earnings per share were up 37% last year (boosted by the cut in the top federal corporate income-tax rate to 21% from 35%). For 2019, the consensus among analysts is for Adobe\u2019s earnings to increase by 16%, followed by a 24% increase in 2020.Shares of Adobe trade at a forward P/E of 31.6. \u201cWhen you look at the growth rate and the predictability because of the subscription model, I think people will pay 30 times earnings for quite a long time,\u201d Plumb said.Plumb made an interesting point about Boeing BA, -6.40% : \u201cEvery time our president travels some place, part of that trip involves a quantification or new order for Boeing airplanes.\u201d Sure enough, on Feb. 27, after President Trump arrived in Vietnam to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Bamboo Airlines of Vietnam confirmed a $3 billion order for 10 787-9 Dreamliners and a $12.7 billion order for an additional 100 737 MAX airplanes.One of many fascinating facts about Boeing is how long some of its product life cycles can be. The company rolled out its first 737 model in 1967 and delivered 580 of them in 2018, up from 529 in 2017 and 490 in 2016. And the company\u2019s back orders continue to increase.Boeing\u2019s commercial sales tend to make the headlines, but Plumb said the company continues to score new international deals for military hardware and said the U.S. Air Force\u2019s plan to buy upgraded F-15X fighters from Boeing illustrates the health of the company\u2019s military business. The first F-15 model was introduced into service in 1972.Boeing\u2019s free cash flow per share over the past four reported quarters has totaled $23.55, according to FactSet. Plumb believes it can climb to $30 a share by 2020.Here are the top 10 common equity holdings (of 39) of the Plumb Balanced Fund as of Dec. 31:Here\u2019s how the Plumb Balanced Fund has performed against its Morningstar category:Create an email alert for Philip van Doorn\u2019s Deep Dive columns here.", "title": "The U.S. stock market has now split into the \u2018haves\u2019 and \u2018have nots\u2019"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/harry-boxers-stocks-to-watch-include-canopy-growth-roku-2019-03-06": {"article": "Momentum stocks in marijuana, blockchain and video streaming top our list of charts to watch today.Canopy Growth Corp.

Though the last business I had didn\u2019t go well, I\u2019m still keen to get my product and services out in the public. This year, I have a very special project that I\u2019ve been planning over the past six months. I also have the capital to support the introductory phases of the business.However, I have this massive conflict when it comes to my finances, which I would have to admit, have always been my weak spot. Last year, I started training myself to not be impulsive about my spending and to create a realistic budget that applies to our needs and lifestyle.I\u2019m a mom of one, and my husband is the stay-at-home dad. I work full-time and I allot the majority of my earnings to funding my business venture. However, I\u2019m also the first-born in the family and you could say that we live in poverty. We currently live with my parents in a rented home, but we\u2019re planning to move out.Recommended: The next time you go anywhere, remember the $1 tip is deadThis familial responsibility has always prevented me from going all out in business. There are times when a certain business budget would go to family spending because of emergencies. So, my sites would go down, subscriptions and merchants not paid, because I have to reallocate my funds to family expenses.Meanwhile, as the first-born, I\u2019m torn with this family responsibility of having to \u201csave\u201d my parents from poverty. From rent and other expenses, I feel like I should lighten their burden. Nobody else will. Even the college debt of my sibling falls onto me. If we moved out, we would be comfortable and have food on the table.Do I use my spare cash for the business, which has long-term benefit and good returns, or do I focus on providing for my family and my parents? I can only stretch myself so far and, if I rely on my earnings ($30,000 per year), I can\u2019t get us out of this situation. I can\u2019t build a college fund for my child. I can\u2019t plan for my MBA, and so forth.I\u2019m torn between supporting my parents and pursuing long-term business goals to support my husband and child. What do I do? Do I provide for my family for a year and put everything else on hold? Or do I just trust that my parents will somehow survive \u2014 and pursue my business interests, which have a 50/50 chance of success? I feel like I\u2019ve been in a loop for months and I just can\u2019t get out!Sincerely,First Born in ColoradoDear First Born,You have been shouldering the financial burden for your family \u2014 and they are happy for you to do it. You have been helping to pay off your sibling\u2019s student loans \u2014 and they are happy for you do it. You have been living with your parents and husband and child \u2014 and your parents have been happy for you to do it. You have been putting your own dreams on hold \u2014 and once again your family has been happy for you to do it. I can\u2019t say they\u2019re selfish. They\u2019ve become accustomed to your pace. It\u2019s all they know.Hold a family meeting with your sibling, and talk about the division of familial responsibility. What can each of you afford? What kind of help will your parents need in the years ahead? Why are you paying your sibling\u2019s student loans when you can\u2019t even save enough money for your own child\u2019s education? I applaud you for doing so much, but it\u2019s time to put your own husband and child first. You have a right to live your life. It may be that you and your sibling take turns with your parents throughout the year.Also see: My boyfriend and I have two kids \u2014 should I pay off his $130,000 student debt?Nearly 10 million adults over the age of 50 take care of an aging parent, according to Met Life. The number of adult children caring for an elderly parent and/or providing financial assistance has more than tripled over the past 15 years. One-quarter of adult children provide some type of care for their parents. The estimated lost wages, pension, and Social Security benefits are $3 trillion. For women, lost wages due to leaving the labor force early to take care of an elderly parent totals $142,693.There are ways to be paid as a care giver for a parent rather than be one of the 43.5 million adults in the U.S. who have provided unpaid care to a family member within the prior 12 months: A private contract between you and your parents, tax credits, and Medicaid-funded programs. There are online resources, including the AARP, that can help you see if you qualify for public benefits or state, federal, and private programs to help pay for groceries, prescription drugs, health insurance and home help.Don\u2019t miss: Should two people with $1 million in debt even consider getting married?Members of the Moneyist Facebook Group have some additional suggestions. One writes, \u201cGet thee to the Colorado Small Business Development Center nearest you.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cI had a mentor through the program in Maryland and it was the best thing I ever did. It helped me get an attorney as an adviser and I started my business plan. The classes were free and the money I spent on the attorney and writing were the best $800 I ever spent on NOT starting a small business.\u201dSome words of caution. I applaud your entrepreneurial spirit, and female business owners are sorely under-represented in America. But you are the sole breadwinner and you owe it to yourself and your husband to restore financial stability to your family before pursuing a venture that has a 50/50 chance of succeeding. Only risk what you can afford to lose. At present, that does not seem to be a lot. Keep working on your business plan, but keep in mind a worst-case scenario.You\u2019ve been a loyal daughter and sister, to a fault.

The ads that had been removed contained videos urging users to sign a petition, and cost less than $100 each, Politico said.Late Monday, Warren tweeted that Facebook\u2019s actions were a prime example of why she backs its breakup.\u201cCurious why I think FB has too much power?

After years of relative silence about their charitable efforts, they claimed the top spot after announcing a $2 billion pledge to fight homelessness and improve preschool education.Overall, however, Bezos and his fellow donors gave far less money to charity in 2018. Total giving among the \u201cPhilanthropy 50\u201d amounted to $7.8 billion in 2018, roughly half the $14.7 billion given by the top 50 donors in 2017.Here are the Chronicle\u2019s top 10 donors of 2018:Americans as a whole gave a record amount to charity in 2017, in part because of robust stock-market returns that year. There\u2019s no clear reason for the big drop in giving among the biggest donors in 2018, Di Mento said, but market performance could certainly be a factor. \u201cThere was very likely a great deal of uncertainty last year among donors about how the markets and other aspects of the economy were performing,\u201d she said.See also: American donations to charity show widening gap between rich and poorThe list of top 50 donors includes titans of tech and finance. Many of their donations signaled a keen interest in the future. Much of the money was earmarked to research the effects of artificial intelligence, to preserve online privacy and shore up democracy.\u201cA lot of people who seem to be very concerned about the future are directing significant portions of their giving to try to address things like AI, to make sure it will be used for good rather than bad,\u201d Di Mento said.Don\u2019t miss: These 20 colleges took in 28% of donations to universities last year \u2014 they educate 1.6% of undergradsAmong those was Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who gave $125 million before he died in October to create a new research program at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence that will advance AI\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d problem-solving capabilities.Also notable on this year\u2019s list: more high-profile gifts focused on human services like alleviating homelessness, most notably the Bezos pledge. Others included Salesforce CRM, +0.62%   CEO Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne, whose more than $100 million in donations included $6 million to transform a hotel in San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin neighborhood into housing for the homeless.In the past, donors have been less public about addressing issues like homelessness, Di Mento said. \u201cI think those problems have become much more apparent, and there\u2019s been some criticism of the uber-wealthy and whether or not they should be stepping up for those less fortunate,\u201d Di Mento said.Indeed, there\u2019s been a spate of recent books critical of philanthropy, including David Callahan\u2019s \u201cThe Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age,\u201d Stanford professor Rob Reich\u2019s \u201cJust Giving: Why Philanthropy is Failing Democracy and How it Can Do Better\u201d and Anand Giridharadas\u2019 \u201cWinners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.\u201dWhen Giridharadas looks at lists like the Top 50 donors, he sees a catalog of people who represent \u201cmajor systemic flaws,\u201d in that they\u2019ve built their fortunes in part by perpetuating inequality, he told MarketWatch. \u201cThe point is not that these are all bad people,\u201d Giridharadas said. But their role in our social problems must be acknowledged, he argued. \u201cGenerosity is not a substitute for justice, and this list, like so many similar lists, must be read with balance. Unfortunately extreme generosity is often evidence of profiting from an extremely unjust system.\u201dBezos, to name just one example, has been accused of exploiting Amazon\u2019s workers. The company raised the minimum wage for all its employees to $15 an hour in 2018, a move Bezos said he hoped other companies would follow. Amazon and the Day One Fund declined to comment.Americans with the largest fortunes were not necessarily the biggest givers last year. \u201cAlthough many of the people on the list are household names, not all are, and that is a sign that not all of America\u2019s wealthiest are giving big sums to charity every year,\u201d the Chronicle\u2019s editors noted. In fact, \u201cjust 21 of the people on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans appear on this year\u2019s Philanthropy 50; the rest are less affluent.\u201d However, some donors keep their donations secret, so the Chronicle\u2019s list doesn\u2019t capture all the charitable giving that\u2019s happening.Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

I was fairly better off, my single mother had been expected to marry and have no need for understanding how things like credit worked (her father was a loan officer; it was a different time). At times, we had a little money and, at other times, we ate at the local churches.As a result, my husband and I suffer the same affliction. We were given occasionally some pocket change to buy treats, candy, chips, sodas, etc. This is the only time money would cross our fingertips, and it would be gone within minutes to an hour. Bottom line \u2014 we only know how to spend and not how to save. We only \u201clive for the moment\u201d when it comes to finances.\u2022 We are coming up on our 10th wedding anniversary.\u2022 We have an 11-year-old son.\u2022 Between us we have 3 teenage children from previous relationships that do not live with us.\u2022 We live in Texas.\u2022 We have no life insurance or \u201csavings,\u201d and we rent the condo we live in.\u2022 Our only assets are in a sock drawer.Also see: My husband is unemployed \u2014 we are shamefaced tipping our doormen a pittanceMy husband doesn\u2019t believe in \u201ccredit\u201d (\u201dit\u2019s all made up numbers\u201d). He also doesn\u2019t believe that we can afford life insurance \u2014 even though we dine out several times a week. My husband doesn\u2019t have a bank account and the man owns a sub-contracting company. (Literally, he cashes checks in a strip mall for outrageous fees, and who knows where that money goes.)About 2.5 years ago we bought a property in the woods near a lake, set a small cabin on it, and this is where my husband wishes to retire. It\u2019s valued at $38,000, we owe $29,000. We live in a vacation destination city and in 5 or 10 years, we won\u2019t be able to afford to any more. We have racked up $10,000 in credit-card debt after my husband suffered a fall and broken bones last year.Don\u2019t miss: I earn $15 an hour and will inherit $150,000 \u2014 how do I secure my future?We apparently don\u2019t believe in health insurance either. We are both in poor health, we pay cash for our son\u2019s dental and doctor visits, and because I\u2019m a satisfactory degree of Native American descent, my son and I can run up to Oklahoma for major health needs for free if needs be. I did have to go to the ER last year. I pay $30 per month toward that bill, there\u2019s no interest on the account so I can take my time paying it off. My husband does not pay his medical debt.I was pre-law in college. I\u2019ve always believed in educating oneself to the fullest extent possible no matter your life\u2019s situation \u2014 and so I\u2019ve been reading your letters for years and researching ways to improve my situation for months.\u2022 I do believe in saving a little money even if you don\u2019t make very much. (And I have about $400 saved in a money-market account I opened 2 months ago. Believe me, this is a big deal.)\u2022 I do believe that the poorest people need life insurance the most. (Ever watch \u201cA Tree Grows in Brooklyn\u201d? That mother paid the life insurance man before she put food on the table!)\u2022 I also believe in investing what little you have, even if it\u2019s a small amount of money you were going to spend at the Chili\u2019s Restaurant. I have a Betterment account being used as an additional savings vehicle because over the course of many years, certain bonds and funds tend to be a safe place to keep money, and occasionally grow it by a couple of percent, which is a little better than the money market account.See: I received $500 from an insurer for damage to my car \u2014 can I spend it on me?I also have a Robinhood account where I have deposited a minuscule amount of money for investment testing, which I will only be doing after massive amounts of research on the TD Ameritrade platforms on the account. I\u2019m not going for day trading or swing trading, just looking for possible safe-ish opportunities with minimal risk patterns and possible small growth.\u2022 I don\u2019t believe in giving children money to buy themselves something you would buy them. (If I want my son to have an ice cream I buy him one. If I hand him dollars they go in the \u201cbank\u201d I\u2019ve set up for him at home complete with a check register. We\u2019ve been doing this for 4 years. Occasionally, he will spend money on a big ticket item. Recently, he bought a $30 book.) I don\u2019t believe in \u2019disposable income.\u201d\u2022 My company is starting a 401(k) program with Mass Mutual with a 25% match. (It\u2019s not a lot, but free money is free money. Sadly, as the beneficiary I think my husband would have to sign for it.)\u2022 $7,000 of that credit-card debt we racked up is on my credit cards \u2014 and I only make $12 per hour.\u2022 My husband always said no to savings and investment \u2014 so he is unaware of any accounts mentioned.\u2022 Like I said, we are in poor health and need life insurance if anything, but that\u2019s not something I can get for him on my own. Our youngest child is only 11.Do I enroll in the 401(k) or do I wait until I get the credit-card debt paid down? Can I get a life insurance policy on my husband without his permission? Even maybe final expense? (Oh, I have an AD&D policy for $50,000 for me and $25,000 for my spouse or child, with my sister as the beneficiary. It costs me $10 per month.You see what I mean about affordability? She is also the trusted contact for every other account, because she understands I\u2019m trying to protect just a little of our money from the wasted dollars we spend every month. )I know any earnings I could see on investment is nothing compared to credit-card interest, which I have been charged with paying off all by myself.Basically, I don\u2019t have a plan. And I need one. Help. Thank you.Secret SaverDear Saver,Your case is a classic, the classic, example of why you should discuss your approach to finances before you get married. It doesn\u2019t just impact your happiness, it has multiple effects on your peace of mind, your children\u2019s future, their education, your ability to retire early or at all, insurance against the kind of health emergency that can bankrupt families and cost them their home.Recommended: Should I spend my daughter\u2019s $100,000 trust fund on private schools and ballet classes?Out-of-pocket health costs for elderly Americans aged 65 and over who use Medicare ate up approximately 41% of the average Social Security income in 2013, according to nonprofit organization Kaiser Family Foundation. It expects such costs will soar to 50% of the average social security income by 2030. We are all temporarily abled. As we age, that changes. You need a plan.Keep contributing to your 401(k) plan. Your husband does not have to sign as a beneficiary. You don\u2019t even have to name your husband as a beneficiary. You husband may be beyond hope, but explain to him that for someone who doesn\u2019t believe in debt, he shouldn\u2019t have racked up $7,000 on your credit card. This should be your No. 1 priority. The interest will continue to pile up.Allow me to put your credit-card debt into perspective. A $7,000 credit balance with an 18% annual rate, with a minimum payment of 2% of the balance, or $10, whichever is greater, would take 188 months or just nearly 16 years to pay off. Making minimum payments on your credit card is a long road to nowhere, and making no payments will lead to debt collectors and more stress.You could sit down with your husband to explain how you would like to plan for the future. I don\u2019t know what kind of childhood or upbringing he had that has made him so distrustful of institutions, but he needs to see the consequences of his actions in black and white. If that fails, go ahead and keep making your own plans and never allow him to make purchases on your credit card again.Another tip from a financial adviser. Tristan Harding, director of insurance at PNC Wealth Management, asks you to discuss your health issues with a trusted professional and consider life insurance. \u201cThe life insurance benefit would be able to pay off your credit-card debt and be used as income replacement for your husband\u2019s income at least until your son is no longer a dependent.\u201dKeep instilling your financial values in your children. More than one-fifth of American teens lack basic financial literacy skills. China had the most financially literate teens in the world, when evaluating 15-year-old students\u2019 knowledge in science, reading and mathematics across 15 countries. The U.S. ranked No. 7. Teaching your children to work for what they have is invaluable.The current administration is rolling back Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act that would help people with low incomes and pre-existing health conditions. If you don\u2019t have health insurance through your job, you can read more here about the benefits in Texas and here for cheaper options and Medicaid. There is a legislative effort in Texas to kill the Affordable Care Act.There was a heated and robust discussion of your question on the Moneyist Facebook Page. One member described your husband as an \u201coff the grid\u201d guy. He has genuine fears about institutions and bank accounts. Given the number of data breaches, who could blame him. But living paycheck-to-paycheck is not the answer. Somehow, with the help of family, you have to help him see that.The difficult news: There may come a point where your love for your husband and your need to secure your future become mutually exclusive choices. I believe you have the willingness and obviously the intelligence to build a financial future for you and your children. When you have done everything that you believe can be done, that is a decision you may have to make.Two more things: Good luck.

At that time, she planned to move to Minneapolis to be with her boyfriend. She saved more than $130,000 in a 401(k), about $25,000 in a Roth IRA and kept $20,000 in cash. She also had about $5,000 in a taxable investment account and $10,000 in a health savings account. She also hoped to access a pension she had been entitled to.To supplement her savings, she planned to rent out a property she purchased. She also co-hosts a podcast, freelances doing content management and sells craft items on an Etsy store.She took the leap into \u201cfinancial independence\u201d in March 2017, \u201cecstatic\u201d to experience her new freedom.But life had other plans.The rental property was too complicated to manage from far away. She found that she hated freelancing. Because of some technicalities, she wasn\u2019t able to access her pension yet. There were fewer bites than expected on her Etsy projects. And she and her boyfriend broke up.Now, she\u2019s living with her parents until she finds a new, full-time job, back in the IT world where she started.But she doesn\u2019t regret her choices, she said.\u201cAt the beginning, I had to evaluate the risks,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew the worst-case scenario is that we would break up, I move out and move in with my parents \u2026 I was able to do that because I don\u2019t have anybody depending on me. I can take these risks knowing I\u2019m only affecting myself.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, she learned that she doesn\u2019t actually want to \u201cretire\u201d \u2014 at least not yet.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about myself and the world and what I need in a relationship and what makes me happy and fulfilled in a job,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all of those things, I\u2019m grateful, even if my plans didn\u2019t go the way I wanted them to.\u201dMerz isn\u2019t alone. The idea of \u201cFIRE\u201d, which stands for \u201cfinancial independence, retire early\u201d \u2014 has gained traction in the past several years. Many members of the movement live frugally to meet their goals, including biking instead of driving a car, limiting the amount they spend on food and travel and even producing their own food and clothing themselves. They connect online, through forums and Facebook groups, to encourage one another in their progress.But it\u2019s risky. Before \u201cretirement,\u201d many members of the FIRE movement are working full time jobs \u2014 often lucrative ones \u2014 but they leave all that behind in order to live off their savings for decades.Read: Why does the early-retirement movement have so many haters?And it doesn\u2019t always work out that way.Mr. Money Mustache is largely credited with popularizing the idea of \u201cearly retirement\u201d and encouraging others to spend less in order to work less, too. He was able to retire in his 30s, thanks to a cheap lifestyle, index-fund investing and investing in rental real estate.He lays out the amount one needs to retire early on his website: There\u2019s no magic amount because it varies by person.Aspiring retirees must calculate how much money they take home each year and how much they can live on. They should assume 5% investment returns after inflation during their saving years, he says. And they can plan on a 4% \u201csafe withdrawal rate\u201d in retirement, with some flexibility at times. They should also create a \u201csafety margin,\u201d he said, in case anything unexpected happens.Financial commentator Suze Orman has said she \u201chates\u201d the early retirement movement because most people don\u2019t save enough.Early retirees should actually save upward of $5 million to be on the safe side, Orman said. (And of course, members of the \u201cFIRE\u201d community disagreed.)But unexpected events do happen, and that\u2019s why planning how much you\u2019ll need in retirement is so difficult \u2014 at any age, said Rachel Podnos, an attorney and financial adviser based in Washington, D.C.\u201cEven people who are relatively sophisticated financially underestimate how much they\u2019re going to need,\u201d she said. Between health care, family responsibilities and housing costs, retirement can be expensive \u2014 and not always in the ways you\u2019re anticipating, she said.And going back to work like Merz did may not always be easy, Podnos said.\u201cExplaining to your employer you have this gap in your resume because you decided to retire \u2026 I feel like you would have to come up with a really good spin on that.\u201dThat said, \u201cearly retirement\u201d doesn\u2019t always mean leaving the workforce \u2014 some \u201cFIRE\u201d movement members plan to still work, but won\u2019t need to rely on their full-time incomes any more, said Alison Norris, a certified financial planner and advice strategist at the personal-finance company SoFi.Some members of the \u201cFIRE\u201d community opened up about ways their retirement isn\u2019t going as expected. Here are just a few of their stories.Alli and Matt Owen, a married couple who are 28 and 29, discovered the \u201cFIRE\u201d movement about four years ago. At the time, they were living in Bakersfield, Calif., working in the oil-and-gas industry and making a combined $250,000 a year. They decided to \u201cretire\u201d in 10 years, from when they found out what \u201cFIRE\u201d was.\u201cWe didn\u2019t like where we were living and thought of the FI movement as a way to have more freedom,\u201d Alli said. Their goal: Save $1.2 million by then, so they could live off $40,000 a year for the rest of their lives.But they both began to struggle with mental health issues including anxiety and depression, and decided to leave their jobs earlier than planned, never reaching that $1.2 million goal. Instead, they left work in April 2018 with a combined net worth of $600,000, to travel around the U.S. for about six months.The day before they left, they got some bad news. Their computer had been hacked. And along with it, $17,000 worth of cryptocurrency they bought was gone, too.\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d Matt said. \u201cIt was my responsibility to make sure it was safe, and I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cThere was a lot of self-doubt, like, \u2018Did we make the right decision leaving our jobs?\u2019\u201d Alli said. \u201cIs this a sign we\u2019re going the wrong direction?\u201dUltimately, they still took their trip. The $17,000 wasn\u2019t enough to completely derail their plans. But it did put stress on their relationship, they said.The Owens don\u2019t know what their futures will hold and whether $600,000 will be enough to support it. For one thing, they want to have children, and they\u2019re not completely sure how much that will cost.So to make a little more income, they\u2019ve started two businesses: one to coach others on their finances and another selling a food product for the ketogenic diet.They\u2019re not too worried, Matt said.\u201cThere are other people in the movement who have families,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not very materialistic, they\u2019re not buying a lot of toys and gadgets \u2026 we think kids need a lot of time with us, and that\u2019s the most important.\u201dLiz, a 38-year-old mother of three boys in Connecticut, has always been interested in personal finance, she says. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly when she could retire, but hoped to meet some level of financial independence by the time she was in her mid-50s.To meet that goal, she has not only been a diligent saver, but she also pursued an M.B.A. while working full time, she said. Her habits came in handy six years ago, when her husband almost died of septic shock: an infection that has made it difficult for him to work since.Now, the family\u2019s retirement plan is almost entirely dependent on Liz, a scenario she never expected when she was in her 20s, she says. She worries about others pursuing \u201cFIRE\u201d while relying on remaining in perfect health, or needing the income of a partner, she says.She especially cautions those who may have a plan for health and disability insurance, but don\u2019t factor in additional costs like adapting the home for a disabled family member, or needing to purchase special clothing or foods for them.\u201cThe folks whose plans are based on nothing going wrong, they\u2019ve had nothing serious happen to them or people close to them,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, life isn\u2019t like that. Some of us learn it the hard way.\u201dWilliam McVey, a 45-year-old living in Mason, Ohio, and his wife Amber wanted to retire early even before it was trendy.The plan: Once their twin boys were grown up, they would be able to travel as empty nesters. William is a software engineer, and Amber worked in biotech until she became pregnant with their sons. They devoted her entire salary to savings and lived off William\u2019s income alone.But in 2009 years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Initially, she recovered and lived cancer free. But the cancer returned in 2012, and she died five years ago. Now, William is solely responsible for caring for their twin boys, who are now 16 years old and both struggle with autism.The couple made some smart choices before Amber\u2019s diagnosis and eventual passing, William says. They both had life insurance. Now that Amber\u2019s policy has been cashed, he has earmarked those savings for his sons, but is still able to work flexibly.\u201cI reached my \u2018FIRE\u2019 numbers in the worst possible way,\u201d he said.He continued to work after Amber\u2019s death, but felt he was not spending enough time with their boys. That\u2019s why he works more flexibly now, doing freelance work instead of a full-time role.His advice for those planning to retire along with a partner: Share everything, including passwords to your financial accounts and an overall savings strategy.Talk about what you\u2019ll do in case of divorce or death, way in advance, he says. During Amber\u2019s illness, they never wanted to talk about death, what William calls \u201cgoing to the dark place.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily regret that, but we should have had these conversations,\u201d he says.A blogger who goes by \u201cMrs. Simply FI\u201d, 27, and her husband, 31, have a single income of just $26,000 for their family of five.They work at a camp in the southwest United States: the husband maintains the camp\u2019s computer system, and the wife takes care of their children, while occasionally picking up cleaning shifts and doing freelance photography. But with the job comes free housing, free internet, medical care and free food during the summer months.In the next several years, they plan to buy a school bus and renovate it into a \u201ctiny home,\u201d where they will live with their three children. During that time, the husband may be able to work remotely in IT, but the family will be completely mobile.They are evangelical Christians, and they hope to pursue various ministries in their \u201cretirement.\u201d Being financially independent will help them with that, they said.\u201cOur faith really teaches us that we should be able to leave a legacy for our kids, and for other people too,\u201d Mrs. Simply FI says.But of course, it isn\u2019t so easy.One of their children is 3 years old and has some special needs, for which he needs occupational and speech therapy. And they\u2019re hoping to add more children to their family through adoption.In fact, they recently welcomed a foster child into their home, so they are taking care of four children on the same salary that supported three. That will delay \u201cFIRE\u201d for the family. But that\u2019s OK, Mrs. Simply FI says.\u201cThe whole point for us is not to achieve a certain number. It\u2019s to build a life for ourselves and our children that is satisfying and reaches the goals that we have,\u201d she said. \u201cPart of that for us is that we love our children and children in general. If we have an opportunity to adopt a child it\u2019s worth it to us to move our date by a year or two to build a life that we\u2019re wanting.\u201dTime will tell whether they\u2019re able to \u201cretire,\u201d she says. Right now, they\u2019re taking the steps to make it happen, including putting more than half of their income toward remaining student loan debt.And having a nest egg will benefit the family, even if complete retirement isn\u2019t possible, she says.Unexpected expenses \u201cwould pop up anyway,\u201d she says. \u201cAt least we\u2019d be in a better position when they do happen.\u201dNo matter what age you\u2019re planning to retire, spend time beforehand imagining what you want your life to look like, Norris of SoFi said. That will help you \u201cassign a price tag to your retirement goal,\u201d she said.And if you save too little, it doesn\u2019t have to be a disaster.You may be able to re-enter the workforce. You may have to reduce your spending as much as you can. Homeowners might have to consider a reverse mortgage, which means converting part of your home equity to cash.Just consider the unknowns that could come up, including market volatility, long-term care needs and any changes in the tax code that could come up, Norris said.And if you\u2019re like Merz, you can take it in stride.\u201cI didn\u2019t need anyone to tell me, \u2018I told you so,\u2019\u201d Merz said. \u201cThis was something I needed to come to myself.

The deal will also be backed by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, sources said.Entertainment giant Disney DIS, +0.01%   is selling YES along with 21 other regional sports channels throughout the country as part of its $71 billion deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox FOX, +0.47%  . Disney, which owns ESPN, needs to sell the Fox-owned RSNs to gain regulatory approval for the merger.The YES network was valued at $3.9 billion in 2014 when Fox paid for an 80 percent stake \u2014 leaving the Yankees with the rest.But the value of RSNs generally have been declining as cable subscribers jump ship \u2014 thanks to streaming video companies like Netflix NFLX, -0.54%   and Amazon.The Amazon-led group is expected to seek to offset the decline by charging fees for streamed games, a source said.\u201cIf you are buying YES and understand the streaming transition \u2026 you may be buying it at a bargain,\u201d one source said.In the last few weeks, as the Amazon deal was solidifying, the Yankees told YES it would not renew its streaming license with the sports network, sources said.The current license expires in roughly five years.The Bronx Bombers have other ways to keep the price down tied to their right of first dibs on the 80 percent up for grabs.If Disney rejects a fair market offer by The Yanks, the price would have to be hashed out in arbitration. And that could take up time Disney does not have since it needs to sell YES and the 21 other RSNs within 90 days of closing on the $71 billion Fox acquisition.On Thursday, Disney CEO Bob Iger told shareholders the deal will close \u201csoon.\u201dYES is also under contract to pay the Yankees broadcast fees until 2042.

But as the company\u2019s streaming project gets ready for launch, agents and producers can\u2019t stop griping about how \u201cdifficult\u201d Apple is to deal with \u2014 citing a \u201clack of transparency,\u201d \u201clack of clarity\u201d and \u201cintrusive\u201d executives, including CEO Cook.One of the biggest complaints involves the many \u201cnotes\u201d from Apple executives seeking family-friendly shows, sources said.\u201cTim Cook is giving notes and getting involved,\u201d said a producer who has worked with Apple. One of the CEO\u2019s most repeated notes is \u201cdon\u2019t be so mean!,\u201d the source said.\u201cHe\u2019s giving feedback,\u201d an agent said of Cook, adding that the CEO has been seen on the Vancouver set for \u201cSee,\u201d a futuristic drama about human kind without sight, and in L.A. for the production of a drama starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston.Apple executives in general have been \u201cvery involved,\u201d this person said, adding that writers and directors prefer to work without corporate intrusions.Apple\u2019s nitpicking over content and technology has led to delays, sources said.The streaming service is widely expected to be unveiled this month, but the final product won\u2019t likely be available to consumers before the end of the year \u2014 and it will offer just a handful of the several dozen shows it has in the works, sources said.\u201cI think people are a little bit irritated because they keep moving the service launch,\u201d one source said, adding that Apple has also vexed its video executives by requiring them to make frequent trips to the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters to approve tech changes, taking them away from their work in LA.Another frustration is that Apple also keeps moving the target on what it wants, sources said.\u201cThey are making big changes, firing and hiring new writers. There\u2019s a lack of clarity on what they want,\u201d the producer said. \u201cA lot of the product is not as good as they hoped it to be,\u201d he said.Cook, 58, has been public about wanting family-friendly content, but insiders say the tech giant has also passed on storylines because they are about potentially controversial topics, like religion or the negative consequences of technology.\u201cThey want a positive view of technology,\u201d the producer noted.Apple burst onto the crowded video streaming scene in June 2017 with news that it was building its own Netflix NFLX, -0.48%   and had hired Sony heads Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg to run it.The Sony execs, who were behind such shows as \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cThe Goldbergs,\u201d have lured many big names to work with Apple, including Witherspoon and Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey and Damien Chazelle, the director of \u201cLa La Land.\u201dBut even Wall Street agrees that Apple\u2019s entry into video-streaming service will likely pale in comparison to Netflix\u2019s or Amazon\u2019s AMZN, +0.43%  .\u201cIn the streaming and content arms race, they\u2019ve been on the outside looking in,\u201d said Dan Ives, an analyst from Wedbush Securities. \u201cEven though they\u2019ve had some deals, it\u2019s been a rounding error.

If they find something they really like, they might go full force into the effort.\u201dTo be sure, some of Hollywoood\u2019s gripes can be chalked up to the Hollywood-Silicon Valley culture clash that also plagued Amazon and Netflix when they first started, including the endless number of non-disclosure agreements Apple requires professionals to sign.\u201cThat\u2019s what Netflix was like in the beginning,\u201d one Hollywood insider said of Apple\u2019s stifling secretiveness. \u201cNDA culture is huge in Silicon Valley, huge in Palo Alto.\u201dApple did not comment.This report originally appeared on NYPost.com.", "title": "Apple\u2019s nitpicking irks Hollywood as streaming project readies to launch"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/charting-a-tandem-breakout-attempt-nasdaq-dow-industrials-clear-major-resistance-2019-02-22": {"article": "U.S. stocks are firmly higher early Friday, rising amid optimism over potential pending China-U.S. trade progress.In the process, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow industrials have ventured atop major resistance intraday \u2014 Nasdaq 7,486 and Dow 25,980 \u2014 tagging nominal three-month highs.

He said Facebook plans to rebuild more of its services around these ideas, much as it has done with the messaging company WhatsApp, which it purchased for $19 billion in 2014.The Facebook chief executive met the skeptics head-on in his blog post, in which he admitted that Facebook does not have \u201cstrong reputation\u201d for privacy (\u201clousy\u201d would have been more accurate).\u201cI understand that many people don\u2019t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform \u2014 because frankly we don\u2019t currently have a strong reputation for building privacy protective services, and we\u2019ve historically focused on tools for more open sharing,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.But he did not answer the big question for investors: How will Facebook make money with targeted ads if it doesn\u2019t have as much precise data on its consumers to serve up relevant advertising?\u201cI just wonder in the long run if it\u2019s in their business model to do it, because they make their money through advertising, just like Google,\u201d said Daniel Goldstein, president of digital marketing agency Page 1 Solutions. \u201cThe reason they can capture so many ad dollars, the reason it has been increasing, is because it has so much good data on consumers \u2014 where they live, who they are, race, marital status, income level. It knows a lot about you.\u201d Goldstein said if most of the communications by consumers are encrypted, Facebook itself won\u2019t have access to them. \u201cNot just governments can\u2019t get to them, but Facebook itself can\u2019t. How is it going to continue to make money?\u201dZuckerberg did not offer much in terms of a more in-depth explanation. It\u2019s possible he is thinking of offering a separate encrypted service as part of Facebook, where people can, as Zuckerberg put it, \u201cconnect privately in the digital equivalent of the living room.\u201d\n\nOne aspect Facebook must be considering is that it may have to charge for privacy, which would be a huge turnaround in its business model, since Zuckerberg has said the social network would always be free. He also did not provide any kind of timeline, except to say that \u201cover the next few years, we plan to rebuild more of our services around these ideas.\u201dMaybe Facebook could offer an encrypted messaging service that could also be used for group discussions and photo and video sharing \u2014 but it would likely have to charge for it, since it could not mine any data from it.Perhaps Facebook is trying to head off U.S. lawmakers, who are considering various privacy laws at the federal level as well as various states looking at consumer privacy laws, such as one approved last year in California.Or maybe Zuckerberg\u2019s post is part of a soon-to-be announced agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, which is reportedly looking at issuing a record-setting, multibillion-dollar fine after an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practices. Zuckerberg may also be trying to stave off a mass exodus of consumers, who are becoming more leery of using the platform after more than a year of scandals involving misuse of user data. (A survey released Wednesday found Facebook has lost about 15 million users in the U.S. since 2017.)Whatever has prompted Zuckerberg\u2019s latest about-face on privacy, Facebook investors are going to want to learn more about how the plan\u2019s implementation, and make sure that the company\u2019s new privacy focus does not throw the baby out with the bath water. It\u2019s going to be a tough \u2014 perhaps nearly impossible \u2014 order for a business built around using our data.Want this type of analysis sent to your inbox?

He notes in a letter posted on the new website that Haven will be an \u201cadvocate for the patient and an ally to anyone \u2013 clinicians, industry leaders, innovators, policymakers and others \u2013 who make patient care and cost better.\u201d The website also outlines a number of areas to improve upon the current health system, including the difficulty people have accessing care, navigating the complex system, and affording their medical treatments and prescription drugs.In January 2018, the three founding companies announced plans to create this independent organization, now called Haven, which is free from profit-making incentives and constraints. Haven\u2019s focus is the 1.2 million employees and families affiliated with Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase across the United States and over time it intends to share what it learns to help others. Dr. Gawande assumed the helm as CEO this past July and assembled a leadership team \u2013 including Jack Stoddard as COO, Serkan Kutan as CTO, Dana Safran as Head of Measurement, and others \u2013 to move the organization\u2019s work forward.\u201cThe good news is the best results are not the most complicated or expensive. Therightcare in therightplace is often more effective and less costly than what we get today,\u201d explained Dr. Gawande.As Haven scales up its operations, the organization is focused on recruiting a range of talented individuals, including software engineers, data scientists, and clinicians to join its team.

To get this column each market day, click here.Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a volatile March start, pulling in respectably from major resistance.Still, the downturn has thus far inflicted limited technical damage, preserving a bullish bigger-picture bias. Broadly speaking, the S&P 500\u2019s pulling-teeth breakout attempt is intact.Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.43%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.As illustrated, the S&P has pulled in respectably from major resistance.The specific area matches the late-October peak (2,816.94) and Monday\u2019s session high (2,816.88) effectively matched resistance.On a constructive note, the S&P has maintained its near-term range, closing firmly above session lows. In fact, the session close (2,792) matched the mid-point of the daily range.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has pulled in more aggressively, briefly tagging two-week lows.Here again, the downturn punctuates a failed retest of the range top.Tactically, the former range bottom (25,762) is followed by an inflection point matching Monday\u2019s low (25,611).Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.65%  has strengthened slightly versus the other benchmarks.Consider that it briefly tagged four-month highs before pulling in to the range.Moreover, the index has thus far maintained major support (7,486) a level closely matching the 200-day moving average. Both areas are also illustrated below.Widening the view to six months adds perspective.On this wider view, the Nasdaq is acting well technically.More specifically, the index has maintained its breakout point (7,486), a level defined by the December peak. Last week\u2019s low (7,485) matched support, punctuating a successful test of major support.Delving slightly deeper, the 200-day moving average, currently 7,479, rests nominally under the breakout point. The Nasdaq\u2019s longer-term bias remains bullish barring a violation of this area.Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has balked at its range top.Still, Monday\u2019s bearish engulfing pattern has thus far inflicted limited damage. The session close (25,820) matched an inflection point at the December closing peak (25,826), detailed previously.Delving deeper, the 20-day moving average, currently 25,644, has underpinned the 2019 uptrend. Monday\u2019s reversal from the session low punctuated a successful retest of the near-term trending indicator.More broadly, the chart illustrates a bull flag \u2014 pinned to the early-February rally \u2014 a continuation pattern improving the chances of upside follow-through. A closing violation of the range bottom (25,762) would raise a question mark.Similarly, the S&P 500 has thus far weathered a single-day whipsaw at major resistance.To reiterate, Monday\u2019s session high (2,816.88) almost precisely matched the range top (2,816.94) and the index has pulled in to its near-term range.As detailed above, the major U.S. benchmarks are off to a volatile March start.Still, the technical damage has thus far been limited \u2014 even on the hourly charts \u2014 and downside follow-through has been lacking early Tuesday.Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has effectively flatlined at major resistance. Two inflection points remain in play:Against this backdrop, the small-cap benchmark has registered seven straight closes within one point of the 200-day moving average \u2014 three higher, and four lower. An extended retest remains underway.Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has strengthened on the margin versus the Russell 2000. Familiar inflection points fall out as follows:Consider that Monday\u2019s close (349.22) effectively matched the range top, preserving a posture slightly atop the 200-day moving average. The prevailing flag-like pattern lays the groundwork for a potential breakout.Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +0.46%  has balked at major resistance. As detailed repeatedly, two areas stand out:Against this backdrop, last week\u2019s close (280.42) matched resistance.More immediately, Monday\u2019s session high (281.87) marked a fractional four-month peak \u2014 its best level since Oct. 10 \u2014 though the SPY has pulled back in to the range. The downturn was fueled by increased, though not off-the-charts volume.Similarly, the S&P 500 remains capped by major resistance. As detailed last week, two inflection points remain just overhead:To reiterate, Monday\u2019s session high (2,816.88) matched the range top \u2014 almost precisely \u2014 and the index has pulled in to the range.Still, the early-March whipsaw has thus far inflicted limited damage. As always, the downturn can accelerate.Tactically, an eventual break from the range top opens the path to a less-charted patch, and potentially swift follow-through. Recall that next resistance matches the January 2018 peak (2,873). (The Oct. 10 session \u2014 the long red bar, punctuating a violation of the 50-day moving average \u2014 was capped by a session high of 2,874.)Conversely, major support spans from 2,742 to 2,750, the latter matching the 200-day moving average. The S&P 500\u2019s intermediate- to longer-term bias remains bullish barring a violation.See also: Charting a V-shaped reversal, S&P 500 hesitates at major resistance.See also: Charting a primary trend shift: S&P 500, Nasdaq reclaim 200-day average.The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.Drilling down further, the United States Oil Fund USO, +0.34%  continues to trend higher. The fund tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light, sweet crude oil.As illustrated, the shares have established a tight two-week range, pressing resistance matching the 100-day moving average, currently 11.80. This is a coiled spring, laying the groundwork for potentially material follow-through on a breakout.Tactically, near-term support matches the top of the February gap (11.57) and is closely followed by the former range top (11.37). A breakout attempt is in play barring a violation.Conversely, an intermediate-term target projects to the 12.60 area on a close atop the February peak (12.06).(On a granular note, the 11.57 support, detailed previously, has defined the post-breakout closing low. Bullish price action.)Moving to U.S. sectors, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR is pressing uncharted territory. (Yield = 3.2%.)Consider that Monday\u2019s session high (57.35) marked an all-time high, narrowly eclipsing the group\u2019s former record peak (57.23) established November 2017.The group\u2019s recent tight range under resistance signals muted selling pressure, laying the groundwork for potentially more decisive follow-through. Tactically, a near-term floor (55.20) matches the former range top, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation.Moving to specific names, Alphabet, Inc. GOOGL, +2.06%  is showing signs of life technically.As illustrated, the shares have rallied atop the 200-day moving average, rising to challenge the five-month range top. Resistance closely matches the October breakdown point, circa 1,152.More broadly, the shares are rising from a modified inverse head-and-shoulders pattern defined by the November, December and February lows. An intermediate-term target projects to the 1,210 area on follow-through.Tactically, the 200-day moving average has marked a bull-bear inflection point, currently 1,133.90. A breakout attempt is in play barring a violation.Separately, Alphabet\u2019s relative strength index (not illustrated) has just registered its best levels since July, improving the chances of eventual follow-through.Initially profiled Jan. 23, Delphi Technologies, Ltd. DLPH, -0.99%  has returned 38.3% and remains well positioned.Technically, the shares have recently knifed to four-month highs, rising amid increased volume after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results.The ensuing pullback has been flat, fueled by decreased volume, positioning the shares to build on the initial spike. Tactically, a near-term floor matches the post-breakout low (21.25) and the rally attempt is intact barring a violation.Eaton Corp. ETN, +0.16%  is a large-cap manufacturer of power-management products. (Yield = 3.3%.)The shares initially spiked six weeks ago, knifing atop trendline resistance after the company\u2019s quarterly results.More immediately, the shares have asserted a flag-like pattern, digesting a break to four-month highs. Tactically, the breakout point (79.20) is followed by the 200-day moving average, currently 77.45, and a sustained posture higher supports a bullish bias.Finally, Nabors Industries, Ltd. NBR, +5.49%  is a mid-cap oil services name coming to life.As illustrated, the shares have reached three-month highs, rising from consecutive retests of the 50-day moving average. (Note that the 50-day\u2019s slope has ticked higher consistent with a trend shift.)Underlying the upturn, the relative strength index (not illustrated) has notched its best levels since May, improving the chances of incremental follow-through.Tactically, the breakout point pivots to support (3.30) and the rally attempt is intact barring a violation. A near-term target projects from the former range to the 3.80 area.Editor\u2019s Note: This is a free edition of The Technical Indicator, a daily MarketWatch subscriber newsletter.

Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.1% increase.Sales had tumbled a revised 1.6% in December, the largest drop since late 2009, just as the U.S. was exiting the 2007-09 recession.

Gas stations reported a 2% decline as the cost of oil fell \u2014 a good thing for American households.Stores that sell clothing and home furnishing also recorded lower sales.On the brighter side, sales surged 3.3% at home centers such as Home Depot HD, +0.54%  and Lowe\u2019s LOW, +0.15% Internet retailers led by Amazon AMZN, +0.61%  also posted a 2.6% increase in sales.Restaurants, pharmacies, grocers and stores that sell sporting goods and hobby items also boosted sales.The even bigger drop in sales in December, meanwhile, is still viewed with suspicion by many economists in light of other retail-industry reports such as Redbook that suggest sales were much better than the government reported.Read: Worker wages post biggest increase in wages in 10 yearsBig picture: The U.S. economy has slowed in early 2019, but not ground to a halt.

Now that I\u2019m 18, where do I go to get vaccinated? Can I get vaccinated at my age?\u201d On Tuesday, he went before Congress to call out social media sites for spreading the misinformation about vaccines that makes people like his parents afraid to vaccinate their kids, just one day after the American Academy of Pediatrics also urged the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Pinterest to filter vaccine misinformation from their platforms.\u201cFor my mother, her love and affection and care as a parent was used to push an agenda to create a false distress. And these sources, which spread misinformation, should be the primary concern of the American people,\u201d Lindenberger told the Senate subcommittee panel, which included Washington state Secretary of Health John Weisman; Dr. Jonathan McCullers of the University of Tennessee; John Boyle, president of the Immune Deficiency Foundation; and Emory University epidemiologist Dr. Saad Omer. They asked the government to put more funding toward vaccine safety research and PSAs to counter anti-vaccine messages.\u201cMy mother would turn to social media groups and not to factual sources like the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention],\u201d said Lindenberger, noting that his mom didn\u2019t get her anti-vaxxer beliefs from Facebook. \u201cIt is with love and respect that I disagree with my mom.\u201dDon\u2019t miss: Teen defies his mother and get vaccinesLindenberger added that he didn\u2019t blame his mom for not vaccinating him. In fact, he grew up agreeing with her that vaccines were harmful.\u201cAs I approached high school and began to critically think for myself, I saw that the information in defense of vaccines outweighed the concerns heavily,\u201d he said. He told lawmakers that it is important \u201cto inform people about how to find good information\u201d and to remind them how dangerous these diseases really are.He\u2019s one of at least three teenagers raised by parents who are against vaccinations who have asked Reddit for help in getting themselves immunized, the Washington Post reported, after doing their own vaccination research online has led them to worry about their health.Lindenberger\u2019s post was upvoted by more than 21.3K readers, and drew more than a thousand comments offering advice about navigating the health-care system, as well as recommendations for pharmacy chains and urgent-care centers that provide vaccinations, and the CDC\u2019s recommended immunization schedule for kids and teens.Lindenberger\u2019s mother, Jill Wheeler, is part the antivaccination movement that has been calling the safety and necessity of immunizations into question for \u201creligious reasons, personal beliefs or philosophical reasons, safety concerns, and a desire for more information from health-care providers,\u201d according to a 2016 report. She recently told NBC News that, \u201cHe\u2019s a great kid. I love him very much, but I feel what he\u2019s representing is wrong. It\u2019s taken away our freedom of speech and my question is, what is going to be next?\u201dWheeler previously lamented to online science magazine Undark that her son\u2019s Reddit post \u201cwas like him spitting on me, saying \u2018You don\u2019t know anything, I don\u2019t trust you with anything. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. You did make a bad decision and I\u2019m gonna go fix it.\u2019\u201d She believes that there are autism risks from vaccines a concern shared by many anti-vaxxers, and perpetuated by celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy and Jim Carrey, that is based on a 1998 study that has been widely discredited and was even retracted by Lancet last year. In fact, a 10-year study of 657,461 Danish children published in the American College of Physicians earlier this week also found no link between the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine and autism, even among children with other risk factors for autism.Don\u2019t miss:The share of kids who aren\u2019t getting vaccinated has quadrupled in the past several yearsStill, 17 states, including Washington, Oregon, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, allow parents exemptions from vaccinating their children for philosophical or personal reasons, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while another 30 states allow parents to opt out of the shots for religious reasons.A minor in Washington who didn\u2019t identify their name or gender also posted on Reddit earlier this year that their mother \u201crefuses to budge\u201d on her anti-vaxx position, even though the teen wants to be fully vaccinated. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am vaccinated against, and I don\u2019t know what vaccines are currently available to me. All I know is that she declined any vaccine that contained mercury (which to my knowledge, is quite a few.) I feel personally enraged by this,\u201d the teen wrote, asking the community what options he or she has. The comments noted that under Washington state law, any minor 13 and older has the right to outpatient treatment \u2014 such as getting vaccines \u2014 without the consent of their parents. And vaccines.gov also has an online search tool for finding where to go to get vaccinated.And a Minnesota 15-year-old also asked Reddit for guidance in getting vaccinated without their anti-vaxxer mother\u2019s consent.The proportion of young kids who aren\u2019t getting inoculations has roughly quadrupled over the past decade and a half, according to a recent CDC report. As a result, about 47,000 children (or 1.3%) born in 2015 hadn\u2019t been vaccinated by 2017, compared with just 0.3% of kids in 2001 \u2014 even though the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine vaccination by age 2 against \u201c14 potentially serious illnesses,\u201d including polio, the measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B and varicella.Don\u2019t miss: As measles outbreak spreads, one anti- vaxxer asks how to keep her child safeNow measles outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and Georgia have some families rushing their pediatricians and area clinics in search of the vaccines, Kaiser Health News reported, with orders for two types of measles vaccines in Clark County, Washington, up almost 500% in January compared with the same time last year after at least 56 cases of the highly contagious virus were reported in Washington and Oregon. The outbreaks have led to lawmakers introducing a bill that would no longer allow children to be exempted from vaccinations due to personal or philosophical reasons.Lindenberger has also noted that while he has received his vaccines, he is now concerned about his four younger siblings, who range in age from 2 to 16.This article was originally published on Feb. 11, 2019, and has been updated with Ethan Lindenberger testifying before Congress.", "title": "Anti-vaxxer teen tells Congress why he vaccinated himself against his mom\u2019s wishes"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/investing-app-stash-launches-debit-rewards-in-an-effort-to-attract-more-banking-customers-2019-03-12": {"article": "Stash doesn\u2019t want to just invest your spare change \u2014 it also wants to keep the rest of your money in a bank account. And the company is set to reward you for doing so.The investing app is officially launching its banking services with Green Dot Corp GDOT, -0.05% First announced nearly a year ago, the company is offering banking services through its investing platform.Now, any American consumer can open a bank account with Stash, which does not charge any overdraft or monthly maintenance fees. Bank-account holders will receive a debit card that can be used for purchases and cash withdrawals. Stash customers will have free access to more than 19,000 ATMs within the Allpoint ATM network CATM, +1.56% Using other ATMs will incur a $2.50 fee from Stash as well as any other fees assessed by the ATM\u2019s owner.Through the partnership with Green Dot, the accounts come with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage. While it\u2019s not possible to cut checks from these bank accounts, Stash is working on an e-check function, which it expects to roll out in the next month, Ed Robinson, co-founder and president of Stash, told MarketWatch.The program has been in beta testing for weeks now. Since the bank accounts were first announced, over 100,000 people joined a wait list, and around 70,000 have opened an account, the company said.Of course, Stash is far from the only fintech firm to explore banking products. Recently, Wealthfront launched its own FDIC-insured cash accounts, which come with 2.24% interest. And stock-trading firm Robinhood attracted a lot of interest \u2014 and then notoriety \u2014 when it previewed its own cash management accounts back in December. Other companies that have taken similar steps include SoFi, Qapital and Acorns.For these companies, offering checking or other forms of cash accounts is a simple way of diversifying one\u2019s business. \u201cThis is also aligned with market volatility and rising interest rates,\u201d said Arielle O\u2019Shea, investing and banking specialist with personal-finance website NerdWallet. \u201cNo doubt these product launches have been in the works a long time, but these companies anticipated market changes. Offering banking services allows a provider to retain assets even if customers decide to pull money out of the market.\u201dAlso see: Consumers requested the lowest number of credit inquiries since 2003 \u2014 why that\u2019s a cause for concernTo help lure people to its bank accounts, Stash is also unveiling a new reward program called Stock-Back. Through this feature, Stash will reward consumers with fractional shares in individual stocks based on where they spend money. In other words, every time a consumer uses their Stash debit card to purchase something on Amazon, they will receive a fraction of Amazon AMZN, +0.65%  stock in exchange.Stash offers different rewards rates for different companies. Purchases for Netflix NFLX, -0.55%  and Spotify SPOT, -0.76%  will earn 5%, while purchases at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts DNKN, -0.55%  and Starbucks SBUX, +1.18%  will earn 2% back in stock.All other purchases will earn 0.125% back, or 0.25% back if the consumer enables a direct deposit into their Stash bank account. (Robinson said that Stash plans to added more companies to its list of businesses that offer higher rewards rates in the future.)For purchases made at retailers that aren\u2019t publicly traded companies, consumers will earn \u201cStock-Back\u201d in a Stash-approved exchange-traded fund, which is currently the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF VT, +0.30%While consumers can open a bank account with Stash for free, to participate in the \u201cStock-Back\u201d program they will need to open an investing account with the company. For those with less than $5,000 invested, they must pay a $1 a month fee to have a Stash investing account. \u201cStock Back is going to help people build portfolios and understand compound interest,\u201d Robinson said.Stash\u2019s stock-back program is something of a rare foray these days. Most banks ditched their debit-card rewards programs after the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 capped the debit card intercharge fees that merchants have to pay financial institutions every time a customer swipes their card. (Stash\u2019s rewards program is funded through interchange revenue, Robinson said.)The \u201cStock-Back\u201d program on the surface is tailor-made for millennials in an age of flashy credit-card rewards offers, O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIn some ways, millennial consumers have come to expect rewards \u2014 there are a lot of banking and investing options these days, and rewards or other perks make those services more attractive,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.Don\u2019t miss: Does stock-market volatility make CDs tempting? Read this firstBut for most customers, the promise of fractional shares may fall somewhat flat.Take the Amazon example: If someone spends, $20 on Amazon with the Stash debit card, they would receive only 2.5 cents\u2019 worth of a share in Amazon (or 5 cents if they set up a direct deposit into their bank account.) As of market close on Monday, Amazon stock was worth $1,670.62. At that rate, a consumer would need to spend over $1.3 million to earn the equivalent of an entire share of Amazon stock back.More notably, consumers would need to spend a substantial amount to exceed the $1 per month fee to have a Stash inventing account.Plus, investing in individual stocks can be a risky enterprise. \u201cJust because you do business with a particular entity, doesn\u2019t mean you want to be an investor with them,\u201d said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.And other rewards offers can be more lucrative. For instance, the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature Card V, +1.24%  earns 2% cash back on all purchases \u2014 and consumers can deposit their rewards directly into any of their Fidelity accounts if they are linked.Moreover, many banks offer substantial sign-up bonuses to new customers. For instance, a consumer can receive $200 when they open a new Chase checking account JPM, -0.41% set up a direct deposit and keep the account open for at least six months.That all said, fractional shares do earn compound interest and dividends, which would enrich the coffers of consumers who invest through the Stock-Back program. For consumers who don\u2019t have strong enough credit to qualify for a credit card \u2014 or, at least one with an attractive rewards program \u2014 Stash\u2019s offering could be attractive, McBride said.Also read: What consumers need to know about the upcoming credit card from Apple and Goldman SachsFor Stash, creating checking accounts isn\u2019t just a way to get customers to use the investing platform \u2014 it\u2019s also designed to alleviate a major pain point. Bank fees are indeed rising for consumers these days \u2014 and could cost them up to six figures over their lives.The average Stash investor pays $364 a year in bank fees, Robinson said. And given that many consumers can\u2019t even afford a medical or other kind of emergency, offering a bank account largely free from fees was seen as a way of making saving and investing easier. \u201cWe wanted to help our customers become investors easier,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cSpending is what you need to get through the short-term, while investing is much longer term. One hand helps the other.\u201dAt the same time, bank accounts let these fintech firms innovate in yet another realm of financial services \u2014 one that is core to the vast majority of consumers\u2019 financial lives, said John Thompson, chief program officer at the Center for Financial Services Innovation, a non-profit financial services consulting firm based in Chicago.\u201cWe know consumers are still looking for better banking and checking account solutions,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEven though a checking account might feel boring, there has been a distinct lack of innovation in that space in recent years.\u201d", "title": "Investing app Stash launches debit rewards in an effort to attract more banking customers"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/comedian-hasan-minhaj-on-student-debt-this-system-has-become-broken-2019-02-26": {"article": "Towards the end of this week\u2019s episode of Hasan Minhaj\u2019s Netflix NFLX, -0.68%  show \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d viewers are presented with a comedic sketch that illustrates the obstacles many borrowers face paying their student loans better than allegations buried in court documents, complaint databases and the media ever could.Mark and Shannon are contestants on a fictional game show. The prize? Having their student debt paid off. It\u2019s a riff on an actual game show with that premise. The fictional couple is saddled with the private student-loan debt of their son, who died in a parkour accident.Comedian John Hodgman, the show\u2019s host, asks the bereaved parents, \u201cIn the long term, is it better to be in an income-based repayment plan or forbearance?\u201d for a chance to win $15,000 off their son\u2019s debt. They use one of their lifelines \u2014 a call to their student-loan company \u2014 where a representative tells them, \u201cForbearance, that\u2019s the best option, I would go with that.\u201dNaturally, that\u2019s the answer they give Hodgman.His response: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the forbearer of bad news, but forbearance actually increases your interest over time. An income-based repayment plan would be more fiscally responsible.\u201d The two are ushered off the game show with no student loan help.That moment mirrors allegations in several lawsuits from state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging student-loan companies steer borrowers towards forbearance to save themselves time and money instead of doing what\u2019s required to help them into the repayment plan that makes the most sense for them.And it\u2019s one of many throughout the 28-minute show where Minhaj and his writing team use comedy to expose one factor that borrower advocates say is exacerbating our nation\u2019s $1.5 trillion student-loan problem \u2014 student-loan companies\u2019 conduct, which they say is enabled by the Department of Education\u2019s lax oversight.It\u2019s widely acknowledged that stagnant wages and rising college costs are saddling today\u2019s young people with debt loads that would have been unfathomable in their parents\u2019 generation. But the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d episode is one of the few pop culture artifacts to highlight the repayment experience.Minhaj, the 33-year-old comedian perhaps best known for his four-year stint as a correspondent on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and his viral 2017 appearance at the White House Correspondents dinner, said in an interview that student debt was one of the most requested topics fans of \u201cPatriot Act\u201d asked the show to cover.\u201cThe key thing that we were trying to figure out is what\u2019s our in? How do we talk about this?\u201d he said. \u201cWhen our news team started looking into loan servicers that\u2019s really where the story broke open for us.\u201dOver the course of his research, Minhaj said he began to understand the role of the Department of Education and the student-loan companies it hires in our nation\u2019s student-loan problem. Upon discovering that the Department is the biggest bank in terms of lending, Minhaj said he had a \u201cWow, how did I not know that, moment.\u201dBut the Department \u201coutsourcing their job to loan servicers was the beginning of how I really wanted to show how this system has become broken,\u201d he said.The show is particularly critical of student-loan giant Navient, which is facing lawsuits in several states over allegations the company mistreated student-loan borrowers. The company says these claims are false. As a way to explain to viewers the harm caused by Navient\u2019s alleged practice of steering student-loan borrowers towards forbearance, Minhaj uses a familiar analogy.Income-based repayment, which allows borrowers to pay off their debt as a percentage of their income, is like Hinge, an online dating site, which uses connections with Facebook FB, +0.27%  friends to make matches, Minhaj says. \u201cIt takes more time to fill out, but it\u2019s reliable,\u201d he says. Forbearance, which temporarily pauses payments, but allows interest to build, is more like Tinder IAC, +0.34% he says. \u201cIt\u2019s quick and easy, but over time you end up regretting it.\u201dIn addition to the deep-dive into the allegations against Navient, Minhaj walks viewers through the history of the student-loan program and companies\u2019 role in it to show how far we\u2019ve come from the program\u2019s original goal of beefing up our educated workforce and making college possible for any student regardless of financial need.To make his point, Minhaj uses a combination of jokes, examples of borrowers spurned by their student-loan companies, including a disabled man whose student-loan company auto-debited his monthly student-loan payment twice from his bank account, and interviews with student-loan company critics like Seth Frotman, the former student loan ombudsman at the CFPB.Minhaj managed to avoid the experience of student-loan repayment by living at home while attending the University of California-Davis. But he said he\u2019s watched friends, relatives and even members of his audience \u2014 there was roughly $6 million worth of student debt spread among the fans who watched the episode taping \u2014 struggle with student debt of their own.Part of what he hopes the episode achieves is putting those challenges in context of the obstacles borrowers face repaying their debt.There is a stigma attached to debt, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a black spot on your permanent record in terms of whether or not you are a responsible adult,\u201d Minhaj told MarketWatch. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201dIndeed, the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d episode highlights some of the obstacles advocates say borrowers are up against, including Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos\u2019s policy of shielding student-loan companies from state law enforcement officials, a loan-forgiveness program burying public servants in the fine print.After highlighting some of these roadblocks, Minhaj \u2014 dressed as a caricature of a college freshman in a white fuzzy Supreme hat, Beats By Dre AAPL, +1.21%  headphones and smoking a vape \u2014 asks Frotman what college freshman need to know as they embark on their schooling.\u201cYou need to realize that once you leave school you need to be on top of some pretty horrific companies,\u201d Frotman tells him.That young adults are saddled with this obligation is troubling, Minhaj said. \u201cTo expect the average student who has so many responsibilities and has so many things on their plate to navigate this without proper information \u2014 it\u2019s asking a lot.\u201dGet a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

I\u2019m not a wealthy guy, but I am pretty blessed. I have my military pension of $45,000 annually, savings of $370,000, I own my home valued by Zillow Z, -1.01%  at $300,000 and it\u2019s mortgage-free. I have little to no health-care costs because I am 65, I have Medicare and Tricare for Life, and I have a long-term care policy in place. Oh, I also have zero debt because I rarely use my one credit card and pay off the balance each month.That said, I can\u2019t help but worry about money. I don\u2019t consider myself a spend thrift and have charitable donations between 10% and 15% each year. Most people would laugh to be in my position, I know, but I constantly worry about running out of money. My brother says it\u2019s because our parents had the \u201cDepression mentality.\u201d I do know that mom and dad always taught us to save something from each paycheck and to plan for the rainy day.Now, here I am at 65 and ready to finally retire and I\u2019m scared that I will become penniless. Please, any thoughts to help ease my mind?Scared of being pennilessDear Scared,You\u2019ve been on red alert your whole life. It\u2019s served you well. But there\u2019s no point in paying off your mortgage and saving a healthy six-figure sum, retiring and having medical coverage, if you can\u2019t sit back and enjoy it at the age of 65. Sometimes, it\u2019s good to write things down. Buy a little black book or set up a special folder on your computer so you can see all of your achievements, goals, income and expenditure in black and white. That may also provide a place for you to store your anxieties or, even better, exorcise them. Writing is cathartic and being able to clearly access and mull over your finances should help you relax.Enlist a financial adviser or, better yet, a financial therapist. The Financial Therapy Association takes a holistic approach to managing personal finances, including your history, anxieties, relationships past and present, and your emotional life. Financial therapists understand that most good and bad financial decisions are also emotional ones. One obvious example: Fear and uncertainty can cause stocks to fall and, during the Great Recession, many people bought high and sold low. With hindsight, after a 10-year bull market, that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense.Recommended: The next time you go anywhere, remember the $1 tip is deadNearly one quarter (23%) of people say a lack of emergency savings is the one financial issue that keeps them up at night. You don\u2019t have that problem. Some 22% say they don\u2019t have enough retirement savings. You don\u2019t have that issue either. Another 20% fear they\u2019ll be the victim of some kind of fraud. Forewarned is forearmed. Approximately 19% worry about losing their job. You\u2019re retired. Finally, 9% fret about losing their health insurance and 7% say poor credit keep them awake. You\u2019ve planned ahead regarding your health insurance and you\u2019ve no need to take out any loans.Also see: My boyfriend and I have two kids \u2014 should I pay off his $130,000 student debt?Here are some suggestions from the Moneyist Facebook Group, some of whom said they shared the same feelings of financial anxiety with you. \u201cTransitioning into retirement and from a savings-based financial mind set to spending is difficult and may take several years to get comfortable,\u201d one member wrote. He also said you should list your fears and face them head on. They often add up to a phantom menace. Another suggested focusing on a hobby, sport or even hill-walking, something that gets you outside and looking up at the sky. Exercise has proven to be good for anxiety. Other readers suggest a part-time job to keep your busy.Here are some ways to use the money you have earned for your retirement to buy happiness. Yes, really. They involve adopting a pet or a senior pet who needs a home, if you don\u2019t already have a dog or cat, enriching your life with cultural experiences and travel, and doing what you do already, contributing to charity. Money gives us freedom to make choices, but time is the only really valuable resource we have, so use your time wisely and don\u2019t waste your retirement by being eaten alive by anxieties. Wake up every morning and tell God or the Universe that you are grateful for one thing in your life. Or thank one of these celestial or cosmic entities for giving you the day.Failing that, one trusty member of the Moneyist group has this sobering thought: \u201cTrade places with me. Then your worrying will be justified.\u201dDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

Half a billion dollars are spent annually on corporate diversity programs, yet only 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 are women. \"Lean Out\" is an ambitious attempt to answer the question few dare to ask: what have we've gotten wrong about women at work?Based on in-depth research and personal experiences, \"Lean Out,\" follows the journey of Orr, a single mom of three trying to find success in her 15-year career at the world's top tech giants. In an eye-opening account, Orr exposes the systemic dysfunction at the heart of today's most powerful corporations and how their pursuit to close the gender gap has come at the expense of female well-being.\"Fewer women at the top is a clear signal that the system is broken,\" says Orr. \"With female-dominant strengths such as empathy and consensus-building being the future of business, the headlines forecast that women will dominate the future generations of corporate leaders. But that won't happen until we stop mistaking empathy for weakness and realize that female success shouldn't hinge on us being more like men.\"The antithesis to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's \"Lean In,\" Orr's \"Lean Out\" provides a new and refreshingly candid perspective on what it's really like for today's corporate underdogs, while challenging modern feminist rhetoric and debunking the philosophy that suggests everyone has to be the same in order to be equal. Offering a compelling new argument for the reasons more women don't make it to the top, \"Lean Out\" is not simply a retort to Sandberg's premise, which Orr believes is based on a male worldview, but a revolutionary path forward to change the trajectory of the lives of women in the corporate world and beyond.Featuring key chapters such as The Leadership Ambition Gap, The Confidence Gap, The Power Reward, and Well-Being vs. Winning, \"Lean Out\" is divided into three sections and addresses the significant need to reexamine the business world's paradigm of a \"successful leader.\" Part one unravels the current \"conventional wisdom\" on women in the workplace, part two offers a new model of understanding for the causes of the corporate gender gap, and part three suggests a new way forward for women individually and corporate America at large.\"Right now, we are on the precipice of change,\" says Orr. \"And with 'Lean Out,' I hope to provide a fresh voice for a new generation of thinkers.\"For more information, visit:\nWebsite \u2013 https://www.marissaorr.com/ \nFacebook \u2013 https://www.facebook.com/AuthorMarissaOrr/\nTwitter \u2013 @Marissa__OrrAbout Marissa OrrMarissa Orr began her Google career over 15 years ago as a founding member of Google's Sales Operations & Strategy team, after which she worked as Vertical Marketing Manager at Facebook.

DIRV, -5.00% (\"DirectView\" or the \"Company\"), a company focused on ownership and management of leading video and security technology companies, today announced that it has entered the Smart Home market with Google Home, Nest, and Ring Doorbell products driving record-breaking sales through the Company's wholly-owned e-retailer website, ApexCCTV.com.ApexCCTV has noted consistent growth since the redesigned platform went live last year. Total inbound traffic to the e-commerce website has increased by 43%. As a supplier, ApexCCTV has the ability to offer the most competitive pricing on the internet. The addition of Smart Home Products like Google's GOOG, +1.78% \"Home\", \"Nest\", and Amazon's AMZN, +0.69% \"Ring\" doorbell products have been strong contributing factors for ApexCCTV's record-breaking increase in orders and revenue of 172% and 185%, respectively. In an effort to further this growth, ApexCCTV.com will be adding roughly 2,300 new products in the coming weeks, doubling the size of its product catalog.According to Markets and Markets in the report titled: Smart Home Market by Product - Global Forecast to 2024, the overall smart home market is expected to grow from USD 76.6 billion in 2018 to USD 151.4 billion by 2024, at a CAGR of 12.02%.

We want to set the bar higher and higher each quarter and I couldn't be more confident in the abilities of DirectView Holdings' subsidiaries.

To get this column each market day, click here.Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks continue to grind higher amid persistently bullish 2019 price action.Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has reached significant resistance \u2014 its four-month range top (2,817) \u2014 punctuating a bullish V-shaped reversal from the December low. The prevailing retest from underneath should be a useful bull-bear gauge.Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.41%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks.As illustrated, the S&P has tagged three-month highs, rising to retest major resistance.Significant overhead matches the March peak (2,802) and is closely followed by the four-month range top (2,817). Though still early, the week-to-date selling pressure near resistance has been muted.Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached three-month highs.Tactically, the breakout point closely matches the December peak (25,980) and pivots to near-term support.Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has also broken out, in its case gapping to four-month highs.From current levels, an inflection point spans from 7,513 to 7,527, the latter matching the bottom of the gap.Delving slightly deeper, the December peak (7,486) is closely followed by the marquee 200-day moving average. Both areas are also illustrated below.Widening the view to six months adds perspective.On this wider view, the Nasdaq has broken out, reaching four-month highs. Two inflection points pivot to support:The relatively decisive breakout \u2014 on the order of 1% atop the 200-day moving average \u2014 resolves a V-shaped bullish reversal, and confirms the Nasdaq\u2019s intermediate-term uptrend. Moreover, the 200-day moving average is a widely-tracked longer-term trending indicator, with a posture higher generally signaling a primary uptrend.(In the current case, the 200-day moving average\u2019s slope has flatlined. Market bears will point to indecision as to the primary trend, while market bulls will point to the early signs of a primary trend shift.)Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has paced the 2019 market rally, building on a late-January break atop the 200-day moving average.More immediately, the Dow has rallied atop the December peak (25,980) and the 26,000 mark.On further strength, the November peak (26,277) is followed by additional overhead, circa 26,440.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has extended its mid-month rally atop the 200-day moving average.Tactically, the week-to-date peak (2,813.5) has registered slightly under the four-month range top (2,817) and the pending retest will likely add color.Collectively, the major U.S. benchmarks continue to grind higher amid persistently bullish 2019 price action.Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow industrials have reclaimed resistance at the December peak \u2014 Nasdaq 7,486, and Dow 25,980 \u2014 a move punctuating last week\u2019s flag-like patterns. (See the Dow\u2019s hourly chart, illustrating a bull-flag breakout.)Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF is challenging major resistance. Consider two inflection points;Against this backdrop, the small-cap benchmark has registered consecutive closes fractionally atop resistance \u2014 closing Monday at 158.19 \u2014 though the retest technically remains underway.Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has sustained a modest breakout. Recall that headline inflection points fall out as follows:The MDY is vying Tuesday for its fifth straight close atop both hurdles. Constructive price action.Looking elsewhere, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +0.44%  has extended its break atop the 200-day moving average.As detailed repeatedly, additional overhead matches the December peak (280.40) is followed by the firmer range top, an area spanning from 281.15 to 281.22.The week-to-date peak (281.31) has closely matched the range top, and the initial pullback from this area is not unexpected.Similarly, the S&P 500 is approaching significant overhead. The specific area matches the four-month range top, and falls out as follows:Put differently, the familiar 2,815-to-2,817 area matches the post-breakdown peaks, and defines a major hurdle.To reiterate, the week-to-date peak (2,813.5) has registered nominally under resistance.On further strength, the S&P\u2019s next notable overhead matches the January 2018 peak of 2,873. (The mid-October long red bar \u2014 the session defining the S&P\u2019s initial breakdown \u2014 is capped by a session high of 2,874.)Conversely, the S&P 500\u2019s first significant support spans from 2,742 to 2,749, the latter matching the 200-day moving average. The S&P\u2019s intermediate- to longer-term path of least resistance continues to point higher barring a violation of this area.See also: Charting a primary trend shift: S&P 500, Nasdaq reclaim 200-day average.See also: Bull trend strengthens, S&P 500 rattles cage on 200-day average.The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library.Drilling down further, the iShares China Large-Cap ETF FXI, +1.04%  has taken flight, rising amid optimism over U.S.-China trade progress. (Yield = 1.9%.)In the process, the shares have gapped to eight-month highs, knifing from an extended test of the 200-day moving average.The breakout resolves a massive double bottom \u2014 the \u201cW\u201d formation, defined by the October and January lows \u2014 and opens the path to potentially material follow-through.Though near-term extended, and due to consolidate, the shares are attractive on a pullback. Tactically, the breakout point (43.50) is followed by the deeper 200-day moving average, currently 42.40.Moving to U.S. sectors, the iShares Transportation Average ETF has reached an extended technical test.Specifically, the group has flatlined at the 200-day moving average, currently 189.50, technically sustaining a slight break higher.Still, the February price action registers as constructive. The initial rally atop the 200-day was fueled by increased volume, and has been punctuated by a lighter-volume sideways chop, improving the chances of eventual follow-through.As always, the 200-day moving average is a widely-tracked longer-term trending indicator. The prevailing retest raises the flag to a potential primary trend shift.Initially profiled Jan. 18, Apple, Inc. AAPL, +1.13%  has returned 11.1% and remains well positioned.Late last month, the shares knifed atop the 50-day moving average, rising after the company\u2019s first-quarter results. The strong-volume breakout confirmed Apple\u2019s initial mid-January trend shift.More immediately, the shares have established a tight February range, digesting the rally amid decreased volume. The chart illustrates a bullish continuation pattern.Tactically, initial resistance matches the prevailing range top (175.60). A near-term target projects to about 184 on follow-through, an area roughly matching the December peak (184.94) and the top of the November gap (184.99).Conversely, a near-term floor matches the range bottom, circa 168.40. A posture higher supports a bullish bias.Devon Energy Corp. DVN, +2.70%  is a well positioned large-cap oil and gas name.Technically, the shares have recently gapped to three-month highs, rising amid a volume spike after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results.The subsequent pullback has been fueled by decreased volume, placing the shares at an attractive entry near the breakout point, and 10.3% under the February peak.SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. SSNC, -0.14%  is a large-cap provider of software solutions to the financial services industry.Earlier this month, the shares gapped to record territory, rising after the company\u2019s strong quarterly results.The ensuing pullback has been flat \u2014 underpinned by the breakout point \u2014 and punctuated by this week\u2019s strong-volume follow-through. Tactically, a near-term floor matches the post-breakout low (58.75) and a posture higher supports a bullish bias.Finally, Kinross Gold Corp. KGC, +2.40%  is a mid-cap Toronto-based miner coming to life.As illustrated, the shares have recently knifed to seven-month highs, rising amid industry takeover activity. (Barrick Gold has recently launched an $18 billion hostile bid for rival Newmont Mining.)The subsequent pullback places the shares at an attractive entry near the breakout point (3.45) and 8.5% under the February peak.Recent strength dovetails with a golden cross \u2014 or bullish 50-day/200-day moving average crossover \u2014 signaling that the intermediate-term uptrend has overtaken the longer-term trend.Editor\u2019s Note: This is a free edition of The Technical Indicator, a daily MarketWatch subscriber newsletter.

The Netherlands-based company processed \u20ac89.0 billion in volume during the half.Adyen went public last June, and shares are up roughly 175% since then as investors continue to bet on the company\u2019s ties to fast-growing tech giants.

Adyen is known for being able to reduce the portion of times in which card payments are wrongly declined, and van der Does said that the company\u2019s track record of higher authorization rates, combined with the responsiveness of Adyen\u2019s system, is resonating with businesses.See also: Here are the big-name startups preparing for 2019 IPOsThe company\u2019s net revenue in North America rose by 93% in the last half, while net revenue from Asia-Pacific climbed 121%. \u201cIf you look at Asian growth, that\u2019s related to the maturity of our product,\u201d said van der Does, referring to the company\u2019s ability to offer acquiring and processing in a \u201cfull stack.\u201dAdyen shares fell 2% in Wednesday trading in Europe.

Yet again.Yes, the stock market is off to the best start of the year in more than three decades.Yes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.38%  has rocketed more than 2,000 points since Jan. 1, and jumped another 360 points on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 SPX, +0.41%  has risen 10% so far this year and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.65%  12%. Apple AAPL, +1.16%  and Google GOOG, +1.92%  have gained 8% each, Amazon AMZN, +0.62%  9%, Facebook FB, +0.31%  27% and Netflix NFLX, -0.53%  33%.And yes, those sitting on the sidelines in too much cash have missed a quick rally. As money manager Josh Brown, CEO at Ritholtz Wealth Management, reminded investors again this week, if you miss the handful of best days on the stock market, you miss out on a huge chunk of the long-term returns.So is that it? If you\u2019re under-invested in stocks, should you be kicking yourself?Not so fast.Sure, hindsight is 20-20. But if you\u2019ve been too cautious of late you\u2019re not alone. And here are five reasons why you weren\u2019t not dumb \u2014 and you may be proven right.1. You haven\u2019t really missed that muchSure, if you\u2019d bought and held you\u2019d have been sitting in stocks during the boom since Jan. 1. But you\u2019d also have been sitting in stocks when they tanked last quarter. The Dow has risen more than 2,000 points this year, but it fell more than 3,000 in the fourth quarter. Even after the rally, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 is still 6% below last September\u2019s peak. The average level on the S&P 500 during 2018 was 2,744, says FactSet. The level today: 2,745. It\u2019s a wash. Meanwhile, the rest of the world has done even worse. The MSCI All Country ex-US index ACWX, +0.16%  is still 12% below its 2018 average.2. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2014 nothing has really changedStock markets around the world plunged last quarter. The Dow fell more than 3,000 points, and the MSCI All-Country World index ACWI, +0.35%  dropped nearly 14%. Wall Street experts argued there were some good reasons: Economic slowdowns in China and Europe, rising interest rates, trade war fears, looming conflicts between a Democratic Congress and President Trump, and weaker corporate earnings. Today? Economists and other observers agree most or all of this is still happening. Corporate earnings may be heading towards a recession. As for interest rates: Yes, U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell has put short-term rate hikes on hold, but most economists say the key figure in finance is the rate on 10-year Treasury notes, which he doesn\u2019t control. That rate on Dec. 31: 2.69%. Today it\u2019s 2.69%.3. You were on the sidelines for good reasonThe S&P 500 has only just \u2014 on Tuesday \u2014 got back level with its 200-day moving average, after spending two months below it. For anyone concerned about risks, as well as returns, this is a key number. Financial historians have found that since 1900 one of the most sensible things any long-term investor could have done was to stay clear of U.S. stocks when the S&P 500 was below its 200-day moving average. That would have saved you the worst bear markets, while keeping you invested during most booms. You\u2019d have actually ended up making more money, for a lot less risk, than someone who bought and held. FactSet data shows it\u2019s also been true, for example, in the Japanese bear market since 1989: While the Nikkei 225 remains barely half its 1989 peak, someone who was in the market only while it traded above the 200-day moving average would actually be heavily in profit over that time.4. You\u2019re smart not to discount the current risksFrom the viewpoint of long-term investment, major risks remain according to some long-term strategists. Yes, conventional wisdom on Wall Street tells you that stocks are likely to gain an average of around 9% a year. And yes, that\u2019s based on the historic average going back at least to the 1920s. But, say some financial historians, that\u2019s a misreading of the past. Stocks, they say, typically produced \u201caverage\u201d returns if you bought them at roughly \u201caverage\u201d valuations in relation to things like net assets and net income. And U.S. stock valuations today, they warn, are anything but average.According to price-to-earnings or \u201cPE\u201d data tracked by Yale University finance professor and Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller, the S&P 500 is about 75% above its historic average valuation. \u201cTen-year forward average returns fall nearly monotonically as starting Shiller P/E\u2019s increase,\u201d warned hedge fund manager Cliff Asness of AQR in a 2012 research paper, as he studied the S&P 500 going back to the 1920s. Also, he added, \u201cas starting Shiller P/E\u2019s go up, worst cases get worse and best cases get weaker.\u201dToday\u2019s level? Compared to history, we\u2019re in the most expensive 10% of starting valuations, according to Asness\u2019 data. \u201cAverage\u201d 10-year returns from here? Based on history it\u2019s about 0.5% a year after inflation, he calculated.5. Many big \u2018up\u2019 days take place during bear marketsYes, certainly, the biggest \u201cup\u201d days on the market have historically accounted for a big chunk of long-term returns. \u201cOne of the most common rhetorical bulwarks in the defense of buy and hold investing is to demonstrate the effects of missing the best 10 days in the market, and how that would affect the compounded return to investors,\u201d Cambria Investments manager Meb Faber pointed out in a recent research paper.But, he warns, \u201cThis is perhaps one of the most misleading statistics in our profession.\u201d The reasons? Most of the biggest \u201cup\u201d days took place during bear markets, when the smart move was to be on the sidelines, he says. Oh, and missing the worst days was just as good for your wealth as catching the best ones, he found. From 1928 through 2010, he calculated, the 1% best days gained you, on average, 4.9% each. What about the worst 1% of days? They cost you about 4.9% each.Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

This \"tokenization\" of traditional assets is widely seen as the next great leap forward for global financial markets. Key benefits of tokenization include: 24/7 access to markets, greater liquidity to asset owners, lower transaction costs, faster automated settlement, augmented compliance check security, and a range of smart contract functionality yet to be fully explored. Importantly, tokenization will also enable fractional ownership of traditional assets - for example, an ownership interest in something less than 1 share in a company.Leveraging these advantages of tokenized assets, DX Exchange is the world's first platform that allows investors to own and trade fractional interests in traditional stocks. By significantly lowering the high price barriers to entry for blue chip stocks, this will empower a vast new population to retail investors (including those in the \"bottom billion\") to actively participate in the global equity markets. Investors in rapidly growing developing economies around the world with low existing levels of equity ownership, will now be able to make fractional investments in major securities including Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, and a range of others.Although India and Indonesia (which together account for 20% of the world's population) are among the world's leading users for global companies like Apple and Facebook, investors from those countries still represent only a tiny proportion of share ownership in those companies. For context, around 50% of people living in the United States currently own stocks, while in India and Indonesia stock ownership sits at less than 1-2%.\"Perlin is already actively working to create greater economic inclusion by providing a new stream of passive income for users on our distributed cloud platform in struggling communities around the world,\" explained Dorjee Sun, CEO of Perlin, \"We will further disrupt the status quo by aggressively leveraging our established networks in India, Indonesia and other emerging economies to support greater user adoption for DX Exchange - including by letting Perlin users to directly trade tokenized stocks on their ground-breaking platform.\"Built on NASDAQ's market leading matching engine technology and surveillance technology, DX Exchange also enables cryptocurrency trading. Combined with tokenized stocks, DX Exchange will therefore facilitate the entry of a huge new population of individuals looking to rise above their economic situations via asset ownership and investment in a range of new and innovative digital asset classes.\"We are incredibly excited to be collaborating with Perlin with its experienced business team, world-leading crew of developers, and disruptive distributed technology,\" said Daniel Skowronski, CEO of DX Exchange. \"Their mission to empower struggling communities globally lines up perfectly with our own mission to open up both traditional equity and emerging digital asset markets to people everywhere regardless of their socio-economic circumstances.

However, he says he has grown bored in his marriage.He met his wife in college, and was drawn to her assertive and sarcastic personality. But years into their marriage Kit says he felt like his wife became demeaning and unkind. They were never able to reach a compromise. They fought constantly, and he grew to resent her.\u201cShe wanted a great big fancy house, I wanted a little house so we could travel more. In the end, we got a big fancy house. It was pretty clear that if I didn\u2019t give in to what she wanted every time it was a constant battle of you give in, and then you resent it,\u201d he said.They had a sexless marriage for five years. One weekend in 2015, during a work trip, Kit had his first affair with a colleague.\u201cIt never occurred to me that I\u2019d have an affair. It just happened. I don\u2019t think either of us saw it coming,\u201d he said. He wife later found out by reading messages on his iPad. Kit moved out, and they started couples therapy a year later.Electronics regularly pop up in divorce cases, experts say. Over 80% of U.S. divorce attorneys say they\u2019ve seen a rise in the number of cases using social networking, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, and more than a third of divorce filings contained the word Facebook, according to a U.K. survey by Divorce Online, a legal services firm.Don\u2019t miss: Millions of Americans keep this dirty secret from their partnerCheating has arguably gotten easier. Dating sites like DiscreetAdventures.com cater to married men and women, and apps like Snapchat SNAP, -1.56%  and Slingshot allow adulterers to send messages that disappear on arrival. But technology cuts both ways: There are apps that also allow suspicious spouses to track their partner\u2019s online activity. (Ironically, couples that met on an online dating site and married were less likely to split, according to a 2013 study published in the journal \u201cProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\u201d)Kit, who preferred to withhold his last name, kept his affairs private, and lives separately in a one-bedroom apartment paying $385 a month for rent. He\u2019s spent around $50 a month on dating sites to meet women, $200 a month on grooming and new clothes, and around $100 a month on dinners and drinks he will typically split with his date.Kit says divorce is off the table because he and his wife ran into some financial trouble after a flood destroyed their home around the time they separated. Paying for their daughter\u2019s private school tuition is also the priority right now over hiring divorce lawyers.He\u2019s currently in a relationship with a married woman. He\u2019ll spend $25 on gas to see his partner, and he has spent $100 on gifts and Champagne. A recent outing at a casino cost $110 a night. For a room, and on each date Kit spends between $75 to $100, he says.He\u2019s not alone. About one in five men and women admitted to cheating on their partners, according to a survey of more than 70,000 adults by MSNBC. com.Men are more likely to commit infidelity, according to a recent survey from Private investigator company Trustify.

The findings showed that 40% of male participants said their marriages ended following the infidelity, while only 19% of women said their marriages ended in divorce, regardless of the unfaithful spouse.Men and women cite different reasons for being unfaithful. Some 14% of men cited the lack of sexual satisfaction in their marriages and desire for more attention as a reason for cheating. For women, 22% said the reason they were unfaithful was a desire for revenge on a cheating partner, according to the survey.Also see: 5 apps for spying on your spouseThe average affair costs around $2,664, or $444 per month, according to a survey by discount code site VoucherCloud. All those hotel rooms, travel, dinners and gifts add up. But the most costly expense related to infidelity stems from divorce. Indeed, infidelity is the most common reason divorcees choose to end a marriage, providing the basis for 37% of divorces, according to a 2014 report from the Austin Institute for the Study of Family and Culture, a conservative think-tank.People are also more likely to prepare for the unmentionable: Infidelity and divorce. In one survey of 1,600 members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, some 63% of attorneys said they\u2019ve seen an increase in the number of clients seeking prenuptial agreements.Protection of property that was owned by one spouse before the marriage was the most popular stipulation of the prenups the lawyers saw (80%), followed by alimony/spousal maintenance (77%) and division of all property bought during the marriage (72%).Eve Helitzer, a matrimonial attorney in New York City, says that because people are marrying later, they\u2019ve often accumulated significant assets by the time they wed, making a prenup more desirable. What\u2019s more, they may want to keep the family business out of reach of a future spouse in the event of a divorce, Helitzer says. Rising property prices may also encourage people to consider signing a prenup.Marriages, themselves, are an investment. Aside from the thousands of dollars a couple may have spent on a wedding, nurturing the relationship at the core of a marriage typically involves a great deal of time and money. Engaging in an extramarital affair is like throwing that investment away. \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of money if you\u2019re not willing to make your partner the priority in your life,\u201d said Tom Gagliano, author of \u201cThe Problem Was Me\u201d and life coach.The average divorce\u2019s price tag is $15,000 in legal fees, according to legal information site Nolo.com. \u201cDivorce is like going through a terrible recession,\u201d said Sterling Neblett, a certified financial planner and founding partner of Centurion Wealth Management in McLean, Va. \u201cOften couples must split their assets in half which feels like losing 50% of your wealth.\u201dMany Americans appear to be \u201cmonogomish\u201d \u2014 that is, they would cheat if they knew they could get away with it, according to a survey of 1,000 people carried out in July by the USA Network. While 82% professed \u201czero tolerance\u201d for cheating, 81% still said they would cheat if there were no consequences.Parenthood appears to be one major motivator of infidelity, the study found. Some 55% of married couples with children agreed that \u201cmarriage is more difficult than I thought it would be,\u201d compared with 34% of couples without children.Elizabeth and her husband is one married couple who agreed to meet other people for sexual encounters, but they only agreed to do so together.She met her husband when she was a freshman in college in 1999. He lived a half hour away in central Illinois and would bring flowers when he\u2019d come to visit her at school. She was attracted to his \u201ctake-charge\u201d personality, a refreshing change from her ex who she says was too much of a pushover.\u201cHe\u2019d come up on the weekend. We spent a lot of time in the bedroom,\u201d Elizabeth, who preferred to withhold her last name, told MarketWatch. \u201cWe\u2019d go out to eat and hang out with his friends. We never really dated. He\u2019d call every other night and we\u2019d talk on the phone for a couple of hours.\u201dHe proposed a year later, but Elizabeth, who was studying to be a teacher, insisted on finishing her degree before tying the knot. They got married in 2003. \u201cWe were the family with the white picket fence, kids and a dog,\u201d she says. \u201cI was working as a teacher and I\u2019d come home had have supper cooked for him. I was the homemaker. I kind of let all of my girlfriends go and my friends became his.\u201dSee also: Meet the wives whose husbands committed white-collar financial crimesAfter they had their son in 2008, they both got bored in their romantic relationship.\u201cBoth of us were each other\u2019s firsts sexually. We kind of wondered what other people would be like,\u201d she says, adding that they started swinging in 2008 using a dating site for married couples, and occasionally posted ads on Craigslist.\u201cWe found out that we weren\u2019t actually physically attracted to each other like we thought we were, and sex was so much better with other people. We liked completely polar opposite things in the bedroom,\u201d Elizabeth admits.Elizabeth met another man at a gas station she frequented on her commute to the school she worked at an hour away from home. He asked for her number.\u201cI didn\u2019t stop and say, \u2018Hey I\u2019m married.\u2019 I was like, \u2018OK, yeah.\u2019 I came to find out he was married too. We kind of stumbled into this affair where my husband didn\u2019t know,\u201d she says.They met in his house when their respective partners were at work, she says. \u201cHe was the cheapest of all the affairs,\u201d she recalls of not having to spend money on hotel rooms or more than $10 on gas everyday.That affair lasted six months, but ended when he got a divorce and expected Elizabeth to do the same. She wasn\u2019t planning on it. Instead, she told her husband about the affair. It put a rift in their marriage for years. They stayed married, but agreed to live financially separate lives. They had separate bank accounts, and split the bills.\u201cFrom that point on it was very easy for him not to see the cost of my affairs and for me not to see the cost of his,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a huge blow out fight yelling and screaming.\u201dElizabeth joined another dating site for married couples that costs between $35 and $89 to message other people. \u201cThe main cost is hotels,\u201d says Elizabeth, who has racked up bills between $62 and $190 a night. She\u2019s offered to split the costs each time, but says her partner\u2019s usually pay the tab.Elizabeth says divorce is not an option for her. \u201cI honestly love my husband. I do. He and I are like best friends who live together. We have two children together. Though we\u2019re not financially tied together, we have a farm house on five acres on land. We built this life together.\u201dFor his part, Kit knows what he\u2019s doing is wrong, but says he has no regrets about his affairs, and plans to pursue a divorce from his wife when he can afford a lawyer.\u201cI spent 20 years in a marriage thinking I was trying to do it right and make it work. Life is too short to feel that way about things. If you have a partner who doesn\u2019t want to be an equal partner it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d(Jacob Passy and Quentin Fottrell contributed to this story.)Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

Others peg it to the closing low scored three days later on March 9.Here\u2019s Slope of Hope\u2019s Tim Knight, fondly recalling the way we were on his blog: \u201cThink about the world in March 2009. Obama was still finding his way around the White House. Facebook was a private company. Netflix was five bucks a share. And ZeroHedge was just a few weeks old.\u201dAnd if the vision of $5 Netflix shares doesn\u2019t make you shake a fist at the sky, here\u2019s Northman Trader\u2019s Sven Henrich, driving it home: \u201cMarch 6, 2009, Kylie Jenner was 11 years old and went on to become a billionaire 10 years later. What did you all do?\u201dHopefully, you managed to get a piece of the 300% gain the S&P 500 has seen since that March day, because the good times are definitely over says our call of the day, from Steven Jon Kaplan of the True Contrarian blog and newsletter.\u201cWe are no longer in a bull market, we peaked last summer. So this is a fake anniversary,\u201d Kaplan told MarketWatch, in an interview on Tuesday. That puts him definitely in the camp of those who aren\u2019t who aren\u2019t celebrating the 10th birthday of this bull market.Kaplan\u2019s observed two bear markets since his newsletter got its start in 1996. He sees a classic mistake being made now in which investors are just looking back to last year, rather than comparing recent performance to the last big meltdowns.For one, U.S. stock valuations are at altitude-sickness levels versus the rest of the world \u2014 either close to or below their average historic levels.\u201cU.S. stock indexes like the S&P 500, as measured by price-earnings ratios, price-to-book, and other measures in their entire history going back to the late 1700s, were only more overvalued relative to their earnings twice before: from late 1999 through early 2000 and during August-September 2018,\u201d said Kaplan.And he also notes that while all global markets rallied at the start of 2018, they then came back down in January, while Wall Street kept going. He said investors just then dived into U.S. stocks, with tax cuts giving people rationale for why stocks were rising when, in reality, it was because they just wanted to own a market that was gaining.Kaplan, who says he\u2019s like to see investors \u201cnot lose 50% of their wealth a third time in 20 years,\u201d says he\u2019s keeping an eagle eye on the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.14% a measure of the U.S. currency against six major rivals. He says that in the last two big market pullbacks, the dollar dropped to a low then suddenly surged higher just before the equity downturn neared another nasty step lower.Here\u2019s his chart that shows how the dollar behaved during the 2007-09 financial crisis, and then another that shows the S&P 500 during that same period. \u201cIf\u2019 you\u2019re an experienced trader, when you get to the bad point, people buy the U.S. dollar as a haven,\u201d said Kaplan.Opinion: Here\u2019s why recent stock gains could be just a bear-market rallyRead: Dow transports on the brink of longest losing streak in about 10 yearsHe says investors shouldn\u2019t just sit on their hands right now and offers up some cheap ideas on how to make money while waiting for the boom to come down on Wall Street. True to his blog name, he likes \u201cunpopular\u201d and contrarian ideas, such as an ETF of Indian companies \u2014 VanEck Vectors India Small-Cap Index ETF SCIF, +0.72% which he says has one of the lowest price/earnings ratios in the world.Also on his shopping list, a fund of small Chinese companies \u2014 Xtrackers Harvest CSI 500 China A-Shares Small Cap ETF ASHS, +1.11% The Global X MSCI Pakistan PAK, -0.96%  is also on his list right now.\u201dIf the U.S. stock market really is in a bear market, why go there when we can invest in all these other markets around the world and get bigger returns?\u201d Kaplan asks.It\u2019s looking like a lukewarm anniversary, with the Dow DJIA, -0.26% S&P 500 SPX, +0.45%  and Nasdaq COMP, +0.67% fairly flat in early action.More coverage in Market SnapshotThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.82%  slipped to 2.703%.

INTC, +0.88% and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.97%  . The price of about $6.9 billion reflects a 14.3% premium on Friday\u2019s closing price of $109.38, and it is more than 50% higher than the going rate before reports first emerged of Intel\u2019s interest in Mellanox on Jan. 30.It is easily the largest acquisition in Nvidia\u2019s two-decade-plus history as a public company; previously, Nvidia has never spent more than about $400 million in any given year on acquisitions, according to FactSet data. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang noted that, when judged against the size of Nvidia at the time of the deals, the company\u2019s acquisition in 2002 of former rival 3DFX for $70 million and up to 1 million shares was larger.Nvidia\u2019s stock opened up 0.6% Monday, then headed higher with gains of more than 1%. Mellanox shares opened nearly 9% higher.Mellanox makes chips and other equipment for high-performance computing, including networking gear and interconnects. Nvidia and the Israeli company have worked together previously on developing high-performance computers, noting in the announcement that they recently worked together on the world\u2019s two fastest supercomputers, which are operated by the U.S. Department of Energy.Nvidia will use Mellanox\u2019s gear to boost its server business. Nvidia has developed its graphics chips into workhorses for machine learning, stacking them into data centers that offer artificial-intelligence power in the cloud. Now it will be able to offer customers even more gear for those data centers, and potentially be able to combine the technologies in new ways.\u201cThe emergence of AI and data science, as well as billions of simultaneous computer users, is fueling skyrocketing demand on the world\u2019s datacenters,\u201d Huang said in a statement. \u201cAddressing this demand will require holistic architectures that connect vast numbers of fast computing nodes over intelligent networking fabrics to form a giant datacenter-scale compute engine.\u201dOpinion: Nvidia has a massive lead in the next big thing in computingHuang said that the combined companies would have an \u201cinitial focus\u201d on high-performance computing, but suggested he wants to take that approach to a larger playground, eventually moving the approach into hyperscale data centers run by large public-cloud purveyors like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.67%  and Microsoft.\u201cI\u2019ve believed for a very long time that Nvidia would go from a chip-level company to a server-level company to essentially a data center-scale company,\u201d Huang said in a conference call to discuss the deal.Mellanox went public in 2007 and crossed $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in 2018. It had $134.3 million in GAAP net income in 2018, also a record, and has been profitable in 10 of the past 13 years, while keeping free-cash-flow positive since 2005.Nvidia stated in the conference call that it is \u201cnot modeling any cost synergies at this time,\u201d which suggests it does not expect to conduct any layoffs while merging the companies. Mellanox will continue to operate out of Israel, and Nvidia said it would \u201ccontinue investing in local excellence and talent in Israel, one of the world\u2019s most important technology centers.\u201dThe deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, and Nvidia said it expects it to close by the end of 2019. Nvidia said it would pay for the deal out of cash on hand, and does not plan to change its investor-return plans in response.Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox.

Sources were not disclosed.\"Amazon's new advertising juggernaut is giving them an unfair net margin advantage,\" said Michael Weissman, CEO of SYNQY. \"To successfully compete, every retailer in America will have to become a retail media publisher if they want to effectively compete with Amazon. SYNQY provides the best path to that solution.\"SYNQY's patented Native Product Advertising Network is the only network that dynamically matches product advertisements with the specific products being sold. This results in a superior shopping experience where shoppers only see ads that are related to the products they are actively shopping for at that moment. SYNQY's Native Product Ads are different from Amazon-like sponsored product ads, which are just links to a product's detail page. The SYNQY solution is not a link. It gives advertisers the ability to deliver the full, engaging brand content shoppers want, without the need for shoppers to leave the page they're on. Often, these interactive ads inform shoppers about new products or inspire them with new recipes.SYNQY's next-generation ad network places ads as close to the time and place of purchase as possible. This eliminates the ad fraud, brand safety risks, inefficiencies and inventory problems found in most digital advertising today and creates a sales lift between eight and 10 percent.SYNQY already provides retail media services to over 2,500 retail locations and works with a dozen major grocery outlets such as Safeway and ShopRite. SYNQY also works with the largest fast-moving consumer goods manufacturers (FMCG) in the world: Nestle, P&G, PepsiCo, Unilever, Tyson Foods, Danone, and Keurig Dr Pepper to deliver advertisements to millions of grocery shoppers each month.Retail media is a hot new category of advertising that delivers unprecedented benefits to both advertisers and retailers. In 2018, over $10B was spent on retail media, just at Amazon alone. The major reason why retail media is a superior advertising inventory is because shoppers are most receptive to advertising when they shop - not when doing other activities such as watching YouTube videos or using Facebook.Retail media establishes a whole new revenue source for retailers, too. Today, only three percent of shoppers purchase during a visit. So, 97 percent of retail website visitors are not monetized. With retail media, retailers become publishers and all 100 percent of the visitors can generate new revenue. SYNQY opens up a new segment of retail media by monetizing the product listing, coupon and details portions of the retailer site in an entirely new manner.\"Our customers tell us retail media is a no-brainer. It's a new revenue stream for the retailer, improves engagement and lift for the brand, and provides a very subtle and pleasing user enhancement for the shoppers,\" said Weissman.Resources:About\nSYNQY Corporation is an online retail media that enable retailers to monetize existing e-commerce real estate through product-targeted advertisements.

In one experiment, subjects were asked to imagine themselves eating at a fictional restaurant called Rilo\u2019s Kitchen, where the menu touted locally-grown, antibiotic-free dishes like Thai shrimp salad and cedar grilled salmon. Half of participants in the group were given a menu with font that appeared to be handwritten (the menu was printed in DJB This is Me font), while the other half was given a menu typed out in standard Helvetica print.Participants then answered a series of questions about how they perceived the restaurant just by looking at the menu, and how likely they were to engage with it on social media. People who read from the handwritten menu at Rilo\u2019s believed the food was healthier than those who read off the non-handwritten version, and were more likely to post about it on social media.The next group was assigned to an ordinary, non-seasonal eatery where the menu didn\u2019t emphasize the food\u2019s alleged healthiness. Half of the participants were given handwritten menus while the other half was assigned regular typed out menus. The results were much different. Participants reacted negatively to the handwritten menu, and were less likely to post about it on social platforms like Instagram or Facebook FB, +0.29%  \u201cThe handwritten menu had an advantage only with a healthy restaurant,\u201d Stephanie Liu, lead author of the study, told MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s because expectations are higher [at healthy restaurants]. It signals more effort, and people felt that it was more endearing than the machine-written type. They feel the restaurant cares about them, and they become more engaged with them.\u201dLiu explained that in order for the handwritten menu effect to work at a restaurant, it must brand itself as health-focused. So, for example, seeing the handwritten menu item \u201cburger\u201d at a gastropub, or \u201cchicken nuggets\u201d from McDonald\u2019s MCD, +0.32%   would not elicit the same effect.\u201cIf the restaurant has healthy dining positioning, the handwritten menu will lead to more favorable consumer responses than the machine-written menu,\u201d Liu noted. \u201cAt regular restaurants or with fast food, the type face doesn\u2019t matter as much because you\u2019re not expecting that human touch or extra effort.\u201dThe findings are the latest example of how restaurants use design elements to sway consumers. Fast food restaurants are known to display photos of salads and bottled water on their menus. This creates what\u2019s called a \u201chealth halo\u201d and leads customers to believe that all of the food on the menu \u2014 including the burgers and fries \u2014 are healthier than they actually are, research has shown. The color of the walls, lighting and music choices can also influence how much customers eat.At some seasonal eateries, chefs and restaurateurs put as much thought into their menu font and description as they do the food. Take farm-to-table restaurant Halifax in Hoboken, New Jersey, which boasts locally-sourced dishes like maple-smoked wild salmon, rainbow trout, and Atlantic blue cod. Chef Seadon Shouse wants customers to get a taste of the simplicity of his ingredients before they even take a bite.\u201cI feel a clean font helps make people think the food is more clean than maybe a scribe or italicized font,\u201d he said. To achieve that, he opts for a neatly typed print called \u201cFutura TOT.\u201dCelebrity chef David Burke, of David Burke Tavern, an American seafood and steakhouse eatery in Manhattan, has a similar mindset when it comes to conceiving his menus.\u201cThe font used on menus should be straight-forward, san serif font, not serif italic or script. Those are harder to read. To highlight healthier dishes, I think using a more delicate font and a bit of color helps to drive home this point. I avoid using script,\u201d he said. One important point: he avoids over-the-top typefaces because they can be off-putting to customers. And diners will skip right over a dish if they can\u2019t read it, he added.", "title": "Menu fonts can make restaurant customers think food is healthier"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-ugly-side-of-facebook-content-moderators-describe-lasting-mental-trauma-2019-02-25": {"article": "Moderating Facebook posts is traumatizing low-paid contract employees, with some developing PTSD-type symptoms, according to a new report.In an article by The Verge published Monday, workers at Cognizant, a Facebook Inc. FB, +0.29%   contractor in Phoenix, describe being subjected to graphic violence, sex and hate speech as part of their daily jobs, in addition to strict workplace rules and stressful productivity targets which all culminates in an atmosphere where employees resort to drug use, sex at the office and offensive jokes as coping mechanisms.The jobs, at a 1,000-person operation resembling a call center, entail each worker reviewing hundreds of Facebook comments and videos each day, encompassing everything from off-color comments to bestiality to videos of murders.Reading a stream of fringe views also warps minds, the report said, with some employees embracing ideas such as Holocaust denial and 9/11 conspiracy theories after working there. One employee reportedly started carrying a gun to the office as protection from unbalanced former co-workers.Many workers, who only make about $28,800 a year, burn out and quit after about a year, The Verge reported. Workers were identified only by pseudonyms, since they had signed non-disclosure agreements with Cognizant.While the company offers on-site counselors, workers told The Verge that the program was not proactive enough and it was incumbent on employees to seek help.Several described lasting trauma, including one man who had watched a graphic video of a stabbing. \u201cI have a genuine fear over knives,\u201d he said. \u201cI like cooking \u2014 getting back into the kitchen and being around the knives is really hard for me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to do the job and not come out of it with some acute stress disorder or PTSD,\u201d another man said.A Verge reporter who visited the facility said moderators expressed pride in the work they do and supervisors expressed care for their mental well-being. But there appear to be few practical solutions to the intense toll the work takes; while Facebook suggests artificial intelligence could one day take over the job, that technology seems far from implementation.Still, \u201cIf we weren\u2019t there doing that job, Facebook would be so ugly,\u201d one worker said.While not directly addressing the Verge report, Justin Osofsky \u2014 Facebook\u2019s vice president of global operations \u2014 said in a blog post late Monday that the social network will take care of its third-party moderators.\u201cWe know there are a lot of questions, misunderstandings and accusations around Facebook\u2019s content review practices \u2014 including how we as a company care for and compensate the people behind this important work,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe are committed to working with our partners to demand a high level of support for their employees; that\u2019s our responsibility and we take it seriously.\u201d", "title": "The \u2018ugly\u2019 side of Facebook: Content moderators describe lasting mental trauma"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/scott-giordano-privacy-and-data-protection-expert-at-spirion-to-share-gdpr-lessons-learned-from-facebook-uber-and-more-at-rsa-2019-2019-02-27": {"article": "ST.

But that clout disappears when it comes to their promoting healthy foods, it found.The researchers, using a sample of 176 U.K. children aged 9 to 11, assigned participants to look at fake Instagram profiles for a 26-year-old female YouTube GOOG, +1.95%  influencer and a 23-year-old male YouTube influencer, both of whom were among the top 10 vloggers most popular with kids in the U.K. at the time of the experiment. Their profiles showed pictures of the vloggers holding unhealthy snacks (like chocolate cookies), healthy snacks (like fruit) or non-food products. Children were randomly assigned to one of these three conditions.The kids then received an array of snacks both healthy (carrots and grapes) and unhealthy (chocolate buttons and jelly candy). Those who had seen influencers holding unhealthy snacks consumed 448.3 calories on average, compared to the 357.1 calories eaten by children who had seen non-food images \u2014 a 91-calorie difference.However, seeing influencers promote healthy snacks didn\u2019t significantly move the needle on food intake. \u201cIncreasing the promotion of healthy foods on social media may not be an effective strategy to encourage healthy dietary behaviors in children,\u201d the authors wrote.Neither YouTube or Instagram were immediately available for comment.Celebrity endorsements of food products can increase kids\u2019 consumption of those items, according to 2013 research in the Journal of Pediatrics. As the authors of the present study noted, \u201cchildren report viewing influencers to be more trustworthy than traditional celebrities, possibly because of increased feelings of familiarity.\u201dMeanwhile, our national appetite for junk food doesn\u2019t appear to have abated. For example, the U.S. salty snacks market hit $24 billion in 2017 and is projected to push past $29 billion in 2022, according to a 2018 report by the market-research firm Packaged Facts. Advertisers are plenty capable of peddling these products: Watching commercials for junk food is correlated with higher calorie consumption from foods high in salt, sugar and fat, a U.K. study last year found.\u201cChildren have a right to participate in digital media and a right to protection of health,\u201d the current study\u2019s authors wrote. \u201cFood-marketing restrictions should be applied to new forms of digital marketing, particularly social media, on which vulnerable young people spend a lot of their online time.\u201dGoogle GOOG, +1.95% which owns YouTube, is up 10.8% year to date and Facebook FB, +0.20% which owns Instagram, is up 27.6% year to date, versus a 10% rise for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.30%  and 11.4% increase for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.42%  over the same period.Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

In recent days, House and Senate Democrats have demanded administration documents related to the deal while pressing the Justice Department to open its own investigation into how the White House handled the merger process.The increased scrutiny comes after the New Yorker reported Trump encouraged former economic adviser Gary Cohn to push DOJ lawyers to sue to block the merger.

Trump got his start in the rough-and-tumble atmosphere of New York City real estate development, after all.And so, as someone who pays close attention to how businesses operate, I was glued to the Feb. 27 testimony of former Trump \u201cfixer\u201d and personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who also served as an executive vice president of the Trump Organization.While I learned little that was new, the testimony was still troubling \u2014 but not for what it said about the Trump Organization.Rather, what I found most noteworthy is how the conduct attributed to Trump the businessman, however extreme, actually reflects actions and attitudes that are widespread within corporate America generally.It is well known that Trump runs his enterprises \u2014 both business and governmental \u2014 on loyalty, rather than, say, competence or performance.What Cohen highlighted was just how debilitating, even destructive, the lionization of individual leaders and expectation of loyalty can be, whether we\u2019re talking about Trump, Facebook FB, +0.28%  CEO Mark Zuckerberg or Apple\u2019s AAPL, +1.20%  Steve Jobs.Cohen said he was \u201cmesmerized\u201d by Trump, calling him a \u201cgiant\u201d and an \u201cicon.\u201d Being around Trump was \u201cintoxicating,\u201d he said, and \u201ceveryone\u2019s job at the Trump organization was to protect Mr. Trump.\u201dCohen\u2019s testimony revealed just how blinding that commitment to a mesmerizing individual became, leading him to replace judgment with worship. Cohen admitted both to lying to Congress and to falsifying campaign finance reports in the name of standing by his boss.Cohen\u2019s description may seem startling. But to someone who has extensively studied leadership in business organizations, I recognize an unfortunate pattern that dominates corporate America.Corporations all too often fall into the trap of romanticizing leaders, often to the detriment of performance. By placing their own role front and center, CEOs enhance their self-esteem and justify their power and prodigious financial rewards.And when employees attribute traits like heroism to their leaders, they tend to imbue them with the characteristics of charisma, strength and decisiveness. What gets submerged, unfortunately, is self-judgment and individual initiative.It\u2019s a comforting delusion. There is ample evidence to suggest that the subsequent performance of all-powerful charismatic CEOs often lags behind that of rival companies led by less-celebrated executives.Another highlight of the hearing was Cohen\u2019s testimony that Trump repeatedly deflated his assets to reduce the real estate and other taxes he owed \u2014 while inflating them when it served his purposes. Cohen called Trump a \u201ccheat.\u201dEven though Trump\u2019s alleged behaviors may seem extreme, they are all too characteristic of corporate America\u2019s startlingly widespread penchant to reduce its tax burden \u2014 or avoid them altogether \u2014 by pushing at the boundaries of legality.Many of the biggest American companies take advantage of tax loopholes, like accelerated appreciation, overseas tax havens and so forth, to accomplish the same goal that Trump allegedly sought: a lower tax bill.More than half of Fortune 500 companies with earnings of more than $3.8 trillion paid zero taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2015. More recently, Amazon AMZN, +0.60%  paid nothing on $9.4 billion in profits in 2018.Of course, we won\u2019t know precisely how successful Trump was in avoiding taxes until his tax returns are revealed.But now we get to the big difference.All corporations have their flaws. But when they are public, there are also checks and balances thanks to independent board members and vigilant shareholder advocates, as well as myriad governance and transparency rules imposed by the Security and Exchange Commission.As head of a private business, Trump was able to avoid virtually all of that accountability and transparency.The Cohen hearing suggests Trump may finally learn what it feels like to be the CEO of a public company.Bert Spector is an associate professor at the D\u2019Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University.

A 30-day, $175 package helps newly single folks furnish their new home, have someone assist with address and utility changes, and get discounts on moving company rates.If you really can\u2019t be bothered with logistics, $500 will get you squared away with finding new housing, assembled furniture in your new pad, a customized new neighborhood guide with recommendations for restaurants, bars, gyms and health studios and access to self-care options such as therapy or lawyers if needed for a three-month period.New York-based Onward co-founders and childhood friends Lindsay Meck, 34, and Mika Leonard, 33, say they started the company after both suffered breakups of their own six months apart.\u201cWe both had to move out and restart our lives. I was seeing a lot of the similarities between the emotional and logistical turmoil of it all,\u201d Meck told MarketWatch. \u201cIt was really challenging and, typically, after a breakup you have to get going quite fast.\u201dThe company soft-launched on Valentine\u2019s Day in New York City and, the founders say, has since received almost 100 inquiries. The demographics are an even split of men and women, aged 25 to 40, the company said. They plan to roll out in other cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and D.C. in the coming year.It\u2019s the latest in a slew of new apps and services hoping to capitalize on time-poor and cash-rich people who yearn to take the awkwardness out of life. Instead of actually meeting people organically, for example, the app Meetup allows users to attend events based on their interests \u2014 from outdoor exploration to music and technology \u2014 so people can connect with other members and essentially meet friends on-demand.Instead of having to ask a friend to pay you back for that coffee or lunch they owe you, mobile payment apps like Venmo eliminate the in-person conversation and cut right to the chase with a notification instead. In 2017, startup called Juicero offered pre-sold packets of chopped up fruits and vegetables to users willing to fork over $400 for the machines to do the dicing for them. People soon discovered they could squeeze the packets just as easily by hand.There does, however, appear to be a market to help couples who are splitting up. A number of studies show that couples who co-habitate before marriage have a greater risk of splitting up, considering a little more than 50% of cohabiting couples ever get married.Experts say having a service like this could help \u2014 as long as you\u2019re not using it to avoid conflict or numb the pain or awkwardness related with severing ties with a partner. Having difficult conversations with your partner is healthy, they say, and processing how you feel is good.\u201cBe considerate of the importance of navigating how you end the relationship,\u201d said Dr. Shaun Wehle, a clinical psychologist based in Indiana. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to deal with goodbyes.

Or has it?First came the biggest plunge in retail sales in nine years. Then home construction slumped. And now hiring seems to have hit the skids.The U.S. added a dismal 20,000 new jobs in February, the smallest increase in 17 months and one of the worst performances during the nearly 10-year-old economic expansion. The meager increase fell well short of Wall Street\u2019s forecast and triggered the fifth straight decline in U.S. stocks DJIA, -0.35% SPX, +0.39%    Read: U.S. adds just 20,000 jobs in FebruaryTaken individually, each of these reports appears to exaggerate the weakness in the economy. The February employment report was especially odd after a huge 311,000 increase in hiring in January. Economists say bad weather and the lingering effects of the government shutdown likely skewed the report.\u201cThe deeper you get into the details, the more likely it seems to be that the headline miss was a one-off and not the start of a new worrisome trend,\u201d said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC World Markets.But taken together, these reports clearly show that growth in the U.S. has tapered off since the start of the new year in tandem with the broader global economy.\u201cWe can now add the U.S. labor market to the chorus of global economic indicators pointing to a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.Just how much the U.S. slowed is still unclear.Many economists think the 35-day federal shutdown in late December and January may have thrown a wrench in the ability of government economists to measure the economy. They suspect some of the weak reports are likely to be revised higher.The first big test comes Monday. The government is likely to report that retail sales fell again in January for the second month in a row owing to cheaper gas prices and weaker auto sales.What Wall Street really wants to know is whether the initially reported 1.2% plunge in sales in December stands after the government updates its numbers.Traditional brick-and-mortar stores such as Macy\u2019s M, +0.74%   and Kohl\u2019s KSS, -0.65%  posted disappointing sales, but Amazon AMZN, +0.66%  and other online retailers said the holiday season was a strong one.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, spoke out about Amazon\u2019s HQ2. She described the Long Island City plan as \u201cextremely concerning.\u201dFor his part, Meeks said that he and others had engaged with the company AMZN, +0.67% and that \u201cdialogue and conversation\u201d continued among local politicians and the internet behemoth, which boasts a market capitalization of about $830 billion, as of Tuesday\u2019s close, right up until the deal collapsed.Zell, who made a fortune in real estate before he was 30 and is often credited with creating the modern-day real estate investment trust, or REIT, said that, in his experience, companies like Amazon want \u201ccertainty\u201d and leadership and speculated that the Amazon location in Queens imploded due a lack of those factors.Zell, who was serving as a co-host on the CNBC morning program \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d described the factors that led to Amazon\u2019s quitting the HQ2 project in Gotham as a \u201ctyranny of the minority\u201d and said it would go down as one of the area\u2019s great political mistakes.But it is what he said in the closing seconds of his exchange with Meeks that caught onlookers by surprise \u2014 in an apparent \u201chot mike\u201d moment that Zell may have thought wasn\u2019t being caught on air.Melissa Lee, the anchor of the segment, looked gobsmacked, since the comment was aired uncensored, which ordinarily would be the case when profanities, generally inadvertently, are spoken.CNBC wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment, and a spokesman for Meeks in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to a call requesting comment.Recently, some 80 labor union and local officials and business leaders, in an open letter, attempted to convince Amazon to rethink its decision to abandon the project.\u201cWe know the public debate that followed the announcement of the Long Island City project was rough and not very welcoming. Opinions are strong in New York \u2014 sometimes strident. We consider it part of the New York charm!

To determine this, Knight Frank tracked 100 bottles of the world\u2019s most desirable rare Scotch whiskey and U.K. auction prices on it. (Other studies also show whiskey values rising.)\u201cLast year was a transformational one for rare single malt Scotch whisky,\u201d according to the Knight Frank report. Indeed, a bottle of Macallan set a record in early October going for about $1.1 million, only to be topped a month later by another bottle of Macallan, which sold for a record $1.5 million.The trend is driven, in part, by demand in Asia, the report notes \u2014 where whiskey is seen \u201cas a premium product and an indication of taste and sophistication,\u201d the Financial Times reveals.And it reflects a love affair with whiskey that cuts across income spectrums: More than 66 million 9-liter cases of whiskey were sold in the U.S. in 2018; that\u2019s up from just 47 million in 2010. Indeed, whiskey is so hot right now that there are hotels with a whiskey theme and those that offer Bourbon-infused spa treatments. There is also an increasing number of whiskey festivals.The uber-rich take it even further, building rooms in their homes to house whiskey. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos \u2014 who\u2019s been spotted out sipping single-malt whiskey \u2014 has plans for a whiskey cellar in his D.C. estate, according to house plans uncovered by The Washingtonian.But before you plunk your money into whiskey, note that the Knight Frank index only focuses on the highest-end bottles, and that 21 of those 100 bottles measured did fall in value.

Some would argue a campaign \u201cin support of\u201d hate crimes is not the same as a campaign for the legal defense of someone accused of them. Of course, GoFundMe is a private corporation and is under no legal obligation to help anyone raise any money for anything.Daryl Hatton, CEO of crowdfunding rival ConnectionPoint, notes that crowdfunding companies can\u2019t raise money to pay for someone\u2019s bail. \u201cRaising money for bail is prohibited by the payment processors and the credit-card companies,\u201d he says. \u201cAs crowdfunding platforms we have to comply with these prohibitions.\u201d (The prohibition apparently doesn\u2019t apply to nonprofit groups and companies like Facebook FB, +0.26% which hosted campaigns to raise bail money for immigrant families detained at the border last summer.)Don\u2019t Miss: GoFundMe for Trump\u2019s border wall nears $20 million, closing in on major liberal cause at No. 1GoFundMe has a variety of rules regarding who can raise money for what on its site. Most of the forbidden activities are not controversial. You can\u2019t launch GoFundMe campaigns for anything illegal. You can\u2019t use it for ransom. You can\u2019t use it to sell counterfeit goods. You can\u2019t use it to finance political campaigns or sell unregulated financial products. You can\u2019t use it for fraud.But legal defenses are, well, legal. Indeed they are guaranteed by the constitution, even in the case of violent crimes, and heinous crimes, such as alleged sex with minors.At the moment there are GoFundMe campaigns on behalf of Roger Stone, Michael Cohen, \u201cjustice for Jussie\u201d Smollett, and for Paul Manafort. (Money raised for Manafort so far: $5.) None are accused of violent crimes, but all are accused of serious offenses.One awkward question raised by GoFundMe\u2019s policies is what would happen if a poor, unknown person \u2014 someone without fame or rich friends \u2014 found themselves wrongly accused of a violent crime. Under the company\u2019s rules, as applied in the case of Kelly, it would seem that they, too, might be unable to raise defense funds on the platform.The paradox is that if R. Kelly had used GoFundMe to pay his legal bills during his battles with the Internal Revenue Service, he might now have some money to pay for his legal defense against charges of sex with minors. GoFundMe rules say nothing about legal defense funds for fighting the IRS.Meanwhile rival GoGetFunding says its doors are open. \u201cWe have hosted a number of legal defense campaigns on our site \u2014 including those for murder, serious crimes, controversial political cases and more,\u201d says a spokeswoman.She added, \u201cI have already spoken with the CEO, who is in agreement that we would allow such a campaign as we are an impartial site that allows those facing legal costs the opportunity to raise funds from their family, friends and supporters in order to ensure they are able to employ the best legal defense they can afford \u2014 as is their absolute right.\u201d\u201cWe are not a legal platform and therefore will never act as judge and jury for any defendant who chooses to use our site,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be for the court system to determine.

In plain English, this meant that while the price was going higher, RSI was going lower.\u2022 As the chart shows, RSI is now making a higher high than the last high. Also, the lows on RSI are rising.\u2022 The foregoing is happening in the overbought zone.In totality, this is a positive pattern and bodes well for new highs in the stock market if prices break out above the resistance zone. This is the most important point here.\u2022 The first chart shows that the The Arora Report gave a buy signal right at the bottom on Christmas Eve.\u2022 The first chart shows that The Arora Report portfolios were up to 61% protected before the stock market decline started.\u2022 The first chart shows Arora\u2019s calls prior to the Christmas Eve low that those lows were not the likely lows.\u2022 The first chart shows that the volume is relatively low on this rally. Normally it is a negative but, paradoxically, in the present context it is a positive. The reason is that the low volume means that there has not been much conviction in this rally and institutions have not jumped aboard. This means there is plenty of fuel left to drive the market higher.\u2022 The chart shows the resistance zone is overhead.\u2022 The chart shows the support zone.\u2022 After a strong rally, often the market pulls back to the support zone.Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.Investors are increasingly becoming familiar with Arora\u2019s Second Law of Investing: No one knows with certainty what is going to happen next.At this time, it is important to pay attention to Arora\u2019s Third Law of Investing: Making investing and trading decisions based on probabilities is the only realistic and profitable approach.If the China deal were announced before the March 1 deadline as originally anticipated, the probability was 70% for the market to fall on a \u201csell the news\u201d reaction.Trump changed the game with two steps. The first step was that new tariffs were not imposed on March 1. The first step gave the market optimism to look forward to the second step of the actual deal. Markets are always looking forward to what is next. Because of the two-step process, the technical picture of the market changed to a more positive one.Also in February, investors were still looking at earnings from the last quarter and realizing that earnings growth was slowing. Such a realization would have sent the market down if a deal were announced at that time. The reason is that investors would have looked to the next item \u2014 slowing earnings growth. Now with the delay in the deal, the specter of slowing earnings growth has become lost.The sum total of the two steps is that the probability of a pullback in a \u201csell the news\u201d reaction has fallen to about 60%, but the probability of an eventual new high in the market has risen.I was talking about Dow 30,000 when the Dow was around 16,000. At that time nobody else was talking about Dow 30,000. Subsequently, I have repeated the call several times. Please see \u201cHere\u2019s the case for Dow 30,000 in Trump\u2019s first term.\u201dBased on what has happened since my first call for Dow 30,000, the Dow reaching 30,000 soon is not a big deal.Momo (momentum) crowd money flows in popular tech stocks such as Apple US:AAPL Amazon US:AMZN and Facebook US:FB continue to increase.

The plan is to continue to book some profits taking advantage of the strength in the market while continuing to hold most long-term core positions.In addition investors may consider focusing on short-term trades, be prepared to trade a \u201csell the news\u201d reaction, buying special situations and buying based on evergreen strategies. Please see \u201cHere\u2019s an evergreen strategy to make money in a volatile stock market.\u201d In summary, the market is not going to continue to go up at this rate and investors should pay attention to probabilities of various scenarios.Disclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.

But the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent change in policy should put that fear to rest.Meanwhile, you can see that REITs have performed very well compared to the broader stock market in the long run. We list S&P 500 REITs, sorted by yield, below.We pointed out in August that a knee-jerk reaction to avoid REITs when interest rates are rising isn\u2019t supported by performance. A rising-rate environment is typically one that also features significant economic growth, which means a REITs\u2019 rental income and earnings will rise. This tends to offset negative price action from rising rates.The Fed\u2019s recent change in direction may have eliminated the usual fear of interest-rate increases, at least for now.And the silver lining is that REITs as a group have measured up well against the broader stock market over long periods. Here\u2019s how the S&P 500 REIT industry group\u2019s total returns (with reinvested dividends) have compared to the entire S&P 500 SPX, +0.37%  over various periods. First, we\u2019ll show total returns and then average annual returns.Total returns through Feb. 15, except as indicated:You can see that the 10-year figures are distorted because in early 2009, we were close to the market bottom that followed the deep declines experienced during the credit crisis.It might be more useful to compare average annual total returns over long periods:The 15-year figures are particularly interesting. Despite the 2008-2009 crisis, the REITs have performed better than the S&P 500, even though the full index is so heavily weighted to large tech stocks, such as Facebook FB, +0.22% Apple AAPL, +1.10% Amazon AMZN, +0.68% Netflix NFLX, -0.55%  and Google holding company Alphabet GOOG, +1.91% GOOGL, +2.06%While we have compared total returns with dividends reinvested, you won\u2019t be reinvesting if you are buying REIT shares for income.It is very important to consider your investment objective. Even if you are not investing in REITs for income, they can help you diversify your portfolio. You should also consider a REIT\u2019s particular specialty and growth prospects when deciding whether to invest.Here are all 32 REITs in the S&P 500, sorted by dividend yield:So a high dividend yield can be a very good thing if income is your objective. But as you can see, the best 15-year performer on the \u2014 SBA Communications Corp.

This makes Sparkcentral the fastest and most encompassing enterprise social customer service platform for enterprises with high volumes of digital interactions that are looking to have their CRM, social media, and Voice of the Customer systems integrated into one platform.Unlike competing solutions that treat each comment or post as an isolated ticket or case, Sparkcentral's platform gives staff the ability to view customer comments or questions in the context of the entire conversation history and assign them to the appropriate agent or marketing staff member. Agents can respond to photo comments, view persistently threaded conversation history, and send content or attachments through a conversation pane with clear visual cues. The addition of Instagram support increases agent efficiency and thus provides the speed and personal touch that customers expect.Instagram announced in June 2018 that they had reached 1 billion monthly active users, after passing 800 million in September 2017 with 500 million daily users. With almost 1 in 8 people on the planet on the app, Instagram support on Sparkcentral's platform was a key addition because it gives brands the flexibility to engage customers with modern technology tools on the most influential social media platforms.\"Instagram's popularity has exploded. Eighty percent of social media influencers prefer Instagram as opposed to others,\" said Tobias Goebel, VP Marketing at Sparkcentral. \"Our support of Instagram fosters better customer engagement and will help turn loyal fans into loyal customers. We offer ample opportunity for brands to be creative and use Instagram as an extension of their brand's personality.\"In an industry where every second counts, saving time and retaining the customer is critical. Sparkcentral helps customer support teams manage large volumes of social inquiries in a streamlined and efficient manner. Its blend of traditional social channels with messaging apps, messaging-style web chat embedded in a website or mobile app, as well as SMS not only increases customer satisfaction (CSAT) but also cuts customer service costs by 30 percent.\"Instagram continues to be a very important channel for our brand, and it is one of the first places our customers go to engage with us. We were already using Sparkcentral for Facebook and Twitter, and now that Instagram is added we love that we can use a single platform for all of our social channels,\" said Samantha Perpignand, Social Media Manager for The Bouqs Company.Other Instagram integration features of the Sparkcentral platform allow support teams to: pull in brand mentions anywhere on Instagram; pull in relevant media at the beginning of every new conversation; allow agents to hide offensive comments on the page; have a consistent UI/UX with other mediums; respond to relevant messages in real time and send attachments and emojis.About SparkcentralBased in San Francisco, California, Sparkcentral is a messaging customer service platform company with a mission to change the way customer service is delivered around the world. Ninety-seven percent of Americans send a message at least once a day according to Pew Research, yet very few of those messages go to businesses. Sparkcentral aims to change that. The company wants to spark a movement to connect businesses with customers through messaging, whether through social media or private messaging channels such as WhatsApp, Messenger, SMS text, live chat, or any other digital messaging means.

It is believed that dogs do not see the color red, so a yellow, white and blue striped flag has been created and was raised at the National WWI Museum and Memorial in Kansas City, commemorating the service and sacrifices of these American military and working dogs.Former Military Working Dog Jet Li and his owner, Pan Douangdara, were the guests of honor at the flag raising ceremony. Jet Li is named after fallen Naval Special Warfare K-9 Handler John \"Jet Li\" Douangdara, Pan's brother, who died in combat in Afghanistan in 2011. Upon Jet Li's retirement (after two tours in Iraq and five years with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department) Project K-9 Hero was amazingly able to place Jet with a family so close to his military experience.\"It doesn't matter if you've left the house for eight minutes or eight hours, dogs are always excited to see you again,\" Douangdara said on Sunday. \"You can throw a ball across the yard all afternoon, and they'll act like it's the most amazing game on the planet. They can sense when you're sick and lie protectively near you. They can sense when you're sad and nudge their nose with your hand affectionately. That's a friendship a dog brings to your life. I am so grateful for Project K-9 Hero for bringing that friendship back into my life with K-9 Jet Li.\"In addition, on National K-9 Veterans Day on March 13, Facebook users are encouraged to fly the K-9 Veterans Day flag themselves with a special blue, white and yellow frame for their profile picture.

Tax season is under way. If that isn\u2019t painful enough, you\u2019ll need to be on the alert for tax-related scams designed to separate you from your money. The Internal Revenue Service says thousands of citizens fall for various schemes each year. Senior citizens are a common target. Here are a few things to know that can help you avoid getting ripped off.The IRS says tax scams can pop up everywhere: in the mail, via email, by telephone (both land line and mobile devices), and on social media networks like Facebook. In short, wherever you are, the bad guys can always find a way to reach you.But guess what? The IRS doesn\u2019t communicate with taxpayers by email, text messages or social media. If you are ever contacted one of these ways by someone claiming to be with the IRS, stop communicating with that person immediately. Note their email address, text number and/or social media account, and send it to IRS (I\u2019ll tell you how below).Mail. If you ever hear from the IRS, it will almost certainly be by good old-fashioned snail mail. Even then, if for any reason you suspect the letter is not on the up-and-up, call the number below\u2014not any number in the letter.There may be times, however, when the IRS will call you\u2014or even come to a home or business. But this is extremely rare. These occasions may concern an overdue bill, a delinquent tax return or a delinquent employment tax payment, or to tour a business as part of an audit or during criminal investigations. But this is quite rare.Even then, says the agency, taxpayers will generally first receive several letters (called \u201cnotices\u201d) from the IRS in the mail.If, on the very slim chance that someone comes to your door claiming to be from the IRS, my advice is to not even open it. Your safety comes first and how are you supposed to know what a real IRS agent looks like?On its website, the IRS says this:\u201cIf an IRS representative visits you, he or she will always provide two forms of official credentials called a pocket commission and HSPD-12 card. HSPD-12 is a governmentwide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification for federal employees and contractors. You have the right to see these credentials. And if you would like to verify information on the representative\u2019s HSPD-12 card, the representative will provide you with a dedicated IRS telephone number for verifying the information and confirming their identity.\u201dI don\u2019t know about you, but I have no idea what a \u201cpocket commission\u201d or \u201cHSPD-12\u201d card even looks like. Do you? So even if someone were to show them to me through my chained front door, I\u2019m still not letting them in. I would call the IRS number on the card and verify the person\u2019s identity. If it\u2019s raining and they say \u201ccan I come in?\u201d the answer is still no.Scammers today can make emails look like the real thing, so if you get one, or a phone call asking for money, here\u2019s another way to tell if it\u2019s really the IRS. The only place you would ever be asked to write a check to would be the \u201cU.S. Treasury.\u201d Period. You should never write a check to any other entity. Past scams have involved asking citizens to pay an alleged \u201cdebt\u201d with a credit card, debit card or even gift card. And obviously, wiring money or handing over cash is a no-no. To learn more about paying a debt to the IRS, carefully review this page.It\u2019s your money! Be careful and be cautious if told you owe anything. Remember, the bad guys are clever and are always refining their ways and using the latest technology to rip people off. For a comprehensive listing of recent tax scams and consumer alerts, visit this IRS webpage dedicated to tax scams and consumer alerts.And if you need to report a scam, the IRS asks you to do so here:\u2022Contact the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration to report a phone scam. Use their \u201cIRS Impersonation Scam Reporting\u201d webpage. You can also call 800-366-4484.\u2022Report phone scams to the Federal Trade Commission. Use the \u201cFTC Complaint Assistant\u201d on FTC.gov. Please add \u201cIRS Telephone Scam\u201d in the notes.\u2022Report an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, or an IRS-related component like the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System, to the IRS at phishing@irs.gov.Three final tips: The IRS will never call or email asking you to divulge personal and/or financial information. If you\u2019re asked to do so, then you\u2019re dealing with a scammer. Shred bank and tax documents before tossing them. bad guys love to snoop through garbage and if they can find a Social Security number, birth date and address, they\u2019re off to the races. Also, keep security software on your computer updated.", "title": "Tax scammers are looking for you \u2014 here\u2019s how to avoid them"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/jargon-raises-18m-to-build-conversation-platform-for-voice-applications-2019-03-07": {"article": "Jargon Inc.

This can include having a number texted to a mobile device or logging into a separate authentication app.In an age of near-daily security breaches, two-factor authentication is seen as a way to help users maintain some control over their online security \u2014 it\u2019s a step that\u2019s often recommended by security experts.Also see: Will Americans pay companies to keep their data private? Here\u2019s their answerJeremy Burge, founder of Emojipedia and vice-chair of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee, flagged the privacy concern on Twitter TWTR, +1.09% Facebook\u2019s account settings allow users to choose who can look them up using a phone number they\u2019ve given Facebook, including phone numbers supplied solely for the purpose of two-factor authentication.But there is no option to make the phone number completely private. Users can only choose to make the number searchable to \u201ceveryone,\u201d \u201cfriends of friends\u201d and \u201cfriends.\u201d As Burge noted, the security setting defaults to everyone, meaning that anyone could theoretically use the phone number to search for and confirm whether a Facebook profile is yours.Burge also argued that Facebook was turning people\u2019s phone numbers into trackable pieces of data that they can use to keep tabs on you across all of their related companies, since other Facebook-owned entities such as Instagram and WhatsApp either require phone numbers or pull in that data from users\u2019 accounts on other platforms. This makes it easier for Facebook to retain data on a user if they delete an account on one Facebook-owned platform, but retain a presence on others.Last year, the company said it was removing the ability to find someone\u2019s profile by using another person\u2019s phone number or email address in the Facebook search function, USA Today reported.A Facebook spokeswoman told MarketWatch that the privacy settings Burge identified were neither new nor specific to two-factor authentication.\u201cToday, the \u2018Who can look me up?\u2019 settings control how your phone number or email address can be used to look you up in other ways, such as when someone uploads your contact info to Facebook from their mobile phone,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said in an email. \u201cWe appreciate the feedback we\u2019ve received about these settings and will take it into account.\u201dWhile phone numbers may not be used to find profiles with the Facebook search bar, there are other ways of looking up people using their phone numbers.Read more: Want to delete Facebook? Read what happened to these people firstThis is just the most recent privacy and security hurdle Facebook has faced. Last fall, the social media company revealed that a vulnerability that allowed attackers to steal Facebook access tokens for some 50 million user accounts, which they could use to take over those accounts. And Facebook was roundly lambasted for allowing user data to be accessed by third parties as a way to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg vowed to improve the access it gives to third-party apps.Other people on Twitter quickly pounced on Facebook following Burge\u2019s tweets, criticizing the company for not doing enough to protect users\u2019 security and privacy. One person described Facebook\u2019s efforts to play around with data it gleaned through two-factor authentication as \u201cthe anti-vaccination misinformation of security.\u201dSome resurfaced revelations from last year, first reported by TechCrunch, that Facebook was using phone numbers supplied for two-factor authentication to hone its advertising targeting.The Facebook privacy revelation isn\u2019t the first-time the security of two-factor authentication has been questioned as a viable security tool. The social-media site Reddit was hacked last year after codes used for two-factor authentication were intercepted by hackers who spoofed the phone numbers of company employees. All user data from 2007 and earlier was exposed in the incident.The good news for consumers wary of handing over their phone number to Facebook: Since last May the company has not required a phone number to sign up for two-factor authentication. Instead, users can choose to download an authentication app such as Google Authenticator GOOGL, +2.10%  to secure their account.And social media isn\u2019t the only online arena where consumers should employ two-factor authentication. The website Two Factor Auth lets users search to see all sites that offer the feature.Don\u2019t miss: This is why most people want to delete Facebook \u2014 it has nothing to do with privacyDespite the importance of two-factor authentication as part of securing one\u2019s online accounts, fewer than half of American have even heard of the process, and even fewer use it, according to the results of a recent survey from security firm Duo Security.Two-factor authentication should be just one piece of a consumer\u2019s approach to securing their online accounts though. Security experts also recommend using a password manager such as Dashlane or Lastpass to further secure their accounts, among other steps.Facebook shares have been up 30% this year to date, compared to a 10.65% increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.28%  and an 11% increase for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.44%  (Kari Paul contributed to this story.)Get a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox.

Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.The biggest crop of new IPOs since 1999 is coming your way this year. Do you recall what happened in the year 2000? The market crashed. Many aggressive technology investors lost 90% of their investments.Prominent among the new potential IPOs are Lyft, Uber, Pinterest and Airbnb; hence the acronym, LUPA.Going forward, LUPA is a convenient acronym to describe this new big crop of IPOs.Here is the trick that those companies, with the help of Wall Street banks, are going to play on you. They are going to bring public only a small number of shares that are significantly lower than the demand. The reason they are going to do this is to run up the stocks. When stocks of new popular companies run up, they create excitement and sentiment shifts toward investing in the new names.This is akin to a new restaurant opening next to an old, popular restaurant. Often there is a long wait for the new restaurant, and business dries up at the old, once-popular restaurant.In large part, especially in the short term, the stock market is a game of sentiment. As excitement builds for LUPA, it is going to crush the sentiment not only toward FAANG stocks but also for other popular tech stocks such as Salesforce CRM, +0.66% Workday WDAY, +0.64% Match Group MTCH, +0.60% and Etsy ETSY, +1.00% Money may also flow out of semiconductor stocks such as Micron MU, +0.51% Intel INTC, +1.04% and AMD AMD, +1.87% into the new IPOs.One of the principles of the ZYX Method of Investing and ZYX Allocation Model that have been responsible for the success of The Arora Report is proper allocation to cash.

The share of online sales grew despite a decline in the overall US smartphone sell-through by 10% year-on-year during the quarter, the latest data from Counterpoint Research's US Smartphone Channel Share Tracker Q4 2018 shows.According to our research, the growth in sales through online channels was aided by the holiday season as consumers sought out and took advantage of holiday deals.Speaking about the competitive landscape, Maurice Klaehne, Research Analyst at Counterpoint Research said, \"Once again Amazon.com takes the highest share of online sales followed by Verizon, with T-Mobile not far behind. Amazon has made a successful business in selling Prime Exclusive phones as well as sub-US$250 unlocked devices. On the carrier side, brick and mortar stores were feeling the pressure from online shoppers. Shoppers are ordering devices online that might not be stocked in retail outlets and are either getting them delivered to a store or even to their own house.\"While Amazon has had a lot of success so far in selling smartphones online, in 2019 we expect Walmart to gain share. Walmart has been increasing focus on e-commerce and online shopping. After acquiring Jet.com in 2016, the company acquired India's top e-commerce portal Flipkart in 2018. Traditionally, Flipkart has been a strong player in the mobile phone and smartphone category. Walmart is expected to benefit and learn from the best-practices of Flipkart which will reflect in its performance in 2019.\nX\nVideo\nMommy, Where's My Photo Going?

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want a federal wealth tax and higher levies on estates.Warren is most intriguing, because she tries to make the case for a wealth tax more in terms of correcting adverse forces within the capitalist system than as a means to finance, for example, Medicare for all or a Green New Deal.She proposes a 2% annual tax on households with assets exceeding $50 million and 3% on those exceeding $1 billion, and cites economists Emanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman to bolster her case for \u201ccapitalism with rules.\u201dSaez is the occasional research partner of Thomas Piketty who created a stir in 2014 with his book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\u201d which allegedly documented the trend for wealth and income to become increasingly concentrated in market economies.Chris Giles of the Financial Times and others found numerous errors in the statistics and basic computations. Martin Feldstein effectively argued that death, estate taxes and division of wealth among multiple heirs\u2014not to mention the penchant of scions like Andrew Carnegie to endow charitable foundations\u2014tend to dissipate family wealth.Wealth always begins with savings and better ideas. Entrepreneurs raise capital\u2014that is how we got Sears SHLDQ, -7.26%  , Macy\u2019s M, +0.59%  and Amazon AMZN, +0.67%  and IBM IBM, +0.74%  , Microsoft MSFT, +0.98%  and Google GOOG, +1.81%   in the first place. Eventually, though, most businesses fall from the control of founding families and patriarchs become portraits on board-room walls.If wealth did not consistently dissipate, income would be increasingly concentrated, as Saez and Piketty allege, among a coupon clipping, unproductive aristocracy. However, recent efforts to document concentration focus on financial and real property assets and income flows and gloss over the contributions to income of human capital.A Treasury economist and professors at Berkeley, Princeton and Chicago found most of the income accruing to top earners is that of entrepreneurs who are still actively managing their businesses\u2014it\u2019s mostly the return on their ideas and exceptional management skills.Once ownership and control transfer to heirs and professional managers, income and businesses eventually decline. A recent American Institute for Economic Research study found that the share of income going to the 10% of earners has hardly varied from its average over the last century by more than 5 percentage points.Even now Jeff Bezos only owns 16% of Amazon\u2014and his pending divorce could cut that in half. Those who fear Amazon will eventually run everything should consider that Sears once built homes and sold automobiles.All businesses have limited scope\u2014the critical idea, product or management process reaches market saturation as Apple\u2019s AAPL, +1.06%  iPhone is now demonstrating. The founders, heirs or stewards of their wealth look for other businesses to invest but eventually lose interest or don\u2019t do well.GE GE, -1.36%  veered far from its roots in electrical equipment, and now serious questions are emerging about Alphabet\u2019s new projects beyond Google\u2019s ad and cloud business.Obsolescence kills businesses\u2014soon Sears and likely Macy\u2019s.Contemporary entrepreneurs throw their weight around in politics but that is nothing new. George Washington was among the richest men in the largest colony and got appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental Army after a mediocre record in the French and Indian War.These days most \u201cdark money\u201d goes to liberals and progressives, not Republicans, the alleged party of wealth. Do Democrats really want to destroy the billionaires who bankroll their movement?Warren says her wealth tax would yield about $275 billion annually but history teaches wealth has quicker feet than the IRS. A good measure of it will move offshore in the wake of such foolishness.What revenue is actually gained will be squandered. California and New York City have among the highest local taxes and the former abounds with potholed roads and the latter sports a wretched subway system.No doubt, if Warren or another wealth thrasher wins the Democratic nomination, Michael Bloomberg and Bezos will put their media machines and money behind them. And if their candidate proves successful then do as Fred Trump did\u2014find creative trusts and other vehicles to make certain smaller entrepreneurs and not their heirs ultimately pay those taxes.", "title": "Opinion: The folly of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/times-up-takes-aim-at-the-health-care-industry-and-the-phone-number-that-secures-your-facebook-account-isnt-as-safe-as-you-think-2019-03-04": {"article": "Happy Monday, MarketWatchers!

Sometimes they\u2019re helpful \u2014 and sometimes they trail you while you shop, make suggestions, \u201ccheck in\u201d on you, and all but shove you to the checkout.Those online ads \u201cchase you around the internet,\u201d says Neeru Paharia, associate professor of marketing at Georgetown University\u2019s McDonough School of Business. They get in your face to convince you to spend.And while online advertising isn\u2019t all bad \u2014 it can expose you to products from companies that can\u2019t afford TV ads, Paharia says \u2014 the persistence and targeting can lead to unplanned purchases.OnlineSay you\u2019re shopping for jeans, and the salesperson takes your measurements and learns about your style to suggest a fitting pair. Marketers learn about you, too, to advertise exactly what you want. Retailers\u2019 targeted advertising tools work within websites to collect your data and track your internet activity. If you browse home-improvement blogs, for example, marketers may show you ads for power drills.Or maybe you\u2019ve been eyeing a specific pair of sneakers. Marketers may plant ads for the same kicks on social media, in articles and sponsored emails. Even if your brain knows that these repeated ads are targeted and designed to make you spend money, your heart may feel that they\u2019re serendipitous. \u201cThe more that we come in contact with something, the more it feels like it should be part of our lives,\u201d says Kit Yarrow, consumer psychologist and author of \u201cDecoding the New Consumer Mind.\u201dThrough appsApps track you in even more ways than browsers, says Rebecca Herold, CEO of The Privacy Professor consulting firm. Most people \u201cmindlessly\u201d agree to app terms, she says, which often grant access to text messages, contacts and other information. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving this huge cloud of data that\u2019s just emanating out of your phone or device and going directly to those who want to sell you something,\u201d Herold says.App providers may sell this \u201cpersonal data exhaust\u201d to third parties for marketing and research, she says. With this information, marketers can serve you especially relevant (and tempting) ads. Consider a running app that tracks your routes. \u201cMaybe [marketers] know from the data that you like pets, and they see that you\u2019re running by a pet store,\u201d Herold says. \u201cThey can make it more likely that you will purchase something there by showing you an ad for a sale or even offering a coupon.\u201dIn social mediaYou may see targeted ads on Instagram, Facebook FB, +0.23%   and Pinterest \u2014 sites where you can easily buy the products advertised. For example, ads for sneakers may show up in an Instagram post or story, where a tap or swipe sends you to the retailer\u2019s website to buy them.Fear of missing out can compound the urge to buy products highlighted in your feed. After all, friends\u2019 curated profiles can make it seem like everyone but you is running on the beach in fancy sneakers, remodeling their kitchen with a power drill, and spoiling their dog with new toys from the pet store.As Yarrow puts it: \u201cAs long as we\u2019re using social media as a way to gauge what we\u2019re capable of having, we\u2019re never going to feel like we have enough.\u201dKeep data to yourself. The less personal data available to marketers, the harder it is for them to inundate you with targeted ads. Remove every app you don\u2019t use, Herold says, and for apps you keep, \u201cchange the privacy and security settings so they block as much of the tracking as possible.\u201dOnline, clearing your cookies \u2014 a kind of tech that tracks your activity \u2014 and using incognito mode can help you browse the internet a little more privately, Herold says, adding: \u201cUsing an anonymous browser, like Tor, will provide even more privacy for your activities.\u201d And if you want to check out those sneakers, you\u2019ll give away less data by going directly to the retailer website, rather than clicking an ad.Pause before you purchase. Buying something through an online ad is tempting, because it\u2019s quick and abstract. \u201cYou see a product, you love it, you wish it was yours, and suddenly it is,\u201d Yarrow says. \u201cIt feels like magic.\u201dBreak that spell by waiting at least 20 minutes before making what could be a more rational decision, Yarrow says. In that time, demystify the purchase by considering other uses for that money. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make it real,\u201d she says. Maybe the cost of those shoes is half a student-loan payment.If you can, wait a couple of days, Yarrow says. \u201cMy guess is that at least half the time, you will forget about it forever.\u201dLaura McMullen is a writer at NerdWallet.

Still, he just suffered a multibillion-dollar loss on one of his high-profile investments.What can we learn from this? Let\u2019s explore with the help of a chart.Please click here for an annotated chart of Kraft Heinz KHC, -0.37% Please note the following:\u2022 The chart shows a big jump in the stock on the Heinz and Kraft merger. The market was excited about the involvement of Warren Buffett and his Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, +0.41%  in the deal.\u2022 The chart shows that The Arora Report gave a signal to sell or short-sell Kraft Heinz on the news. We wrote: \u201cConsumer tastes are changing and neither company is aligned with the new trend.\u201d\u2022 This short signal was one of the hardest we have given, for two reasons. First, who in their right mind would want to short what Buffett was buying? Second, now years later with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that our statement about consumer tastes was prescient. However, at that time, the prevailing wisdom was that organic and healthy food was a niche business and it was not going to adversely impact brands such as Kraft and Heinz, both of which sell processed food.\u2022 As the chart shows, it was a cost-cutting story for a long time.\u2022 The chart shows Kraft Heinz attempted a global-brand grab by offering $143 billion for Unilever UN, +0.38% For those unfamiliar with Unilever, it is a global British-Dutch consumer-goods company on par with the more familiar name of Procter & Gamble PG, +0.57%\u2022 The chart shows that the Unilever bid was quickly abandoned.\u2022 As the cost cutting ran its course and was not providing any new benefits and Kraft Heinz could not find a major acquisition, it simply became a story of the \u201chope\u201d strategy and Buffett\u2019s halo.\u2022 As the chart shows, during a period in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.38% S&P 500 ETF SPY, +0.44% and Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +0.72% performed well, Kraft Heinz lost a big part of its value.\u2022 The chart shows that, finally, the long-overdue admission from the company came and the stock fell.\u2022 Investors who were not paying attention to the \u201cchange\u201d were hit with a bombshell. The change is that consumers are no longer buying processed food and are opting for healthier foods.\u2022 The chart shows the two biggest volume days \u2014 the first on Buffett\u2019s buy and the second on the bombshell.Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies.

China is working on an extremely aggressive multi-billion-dollar plan for government investment into AI research and applications. The U.S. government has been slower to act.The Obama administration issued a report on AI near the end of its term. Since then, little has happened \u2014 until a Feb. 11 executive order from President Donald Trump encouraging the country to do more with AI.The executive order has several parts, including directing federal agencies to invest in AI and train workers \u201cin AI-relevant skills,\u201d making federal data and computing resources available to AI researchers and telling the National Institute of Standards and Technology to create standards for AI systems that are reliable and work well together. These are all good ideas, but they lack funding and bureaucratic structure. So after researching how large organizations use AI for the past five years, in my view the executive order alone is not likely to transform the American approach to AI.China is doing far more than talking about AI. In 2017, the country\u2019s national government announced it wanted to make the country and its industries world leaders in AI technologies by 2030. The government\u2019s latest venture capital fund is expected to invest more than $30 billion in AI and related technologies within state-owned firms, and that fund joins even larger state-funded VC funds.One Chinese state alone has said it will devote $5 billion to developing AI technologies and businesses. The city of Beijing has committed $2 billion to developing an AI-focused industrial park. A major port, Tianjin, plans to invest $16 billion in its local AI industry.These government programs will support ambitious major projects, startups and academic research in AI. The national effort also includes using AI in China\u2019s defense and intelligence industries; the country\u2019s leaders are not reluctant to use AI for social and political control. For example, both AI-driven facial recognition, even to catch jaywalkers, and \u201csocial credit\u201d \u2014 an AI-driven credit score that factors in social behaviors \u2014 are already in use.U.S. investment plans, mostly in the defense industry, are dwarfed by the Chinese effort. DARPA, the Defense Department\u2019s research arm, has sponsored AI research and competitions for many years, and has a $2 billion fund called \u201cAI Next\u201d to help develop the next wave of AI technologies in universities and companies. It\u2019s not yet clear how much real progress its efforts have made.The U.S. has a strong private-sector effort in this technology. There are, for instance, many more AI firms in the U.S. than in China.American investment appears strong, too. In 2015, for example, the combined research and development spending at the U.S.-headquartered companies Google GOOG, +1.78% GOOGL, +1.97% Apple AAPL, +1.05%  , Facebook FB, +0.24% IBM IBM, +0.70% Microsoft MSFT, +0.97% and Amazon AMZN, +0.69% was $54 billion. Much of that spending went toward AI research, but some of the work actually happened in China and elsewhere outside the U.S. That work has been used to personalize ads, improve search results, recognize and label faces and generally make products smarter.In China, the private sector is much more closely tied to government plans than in the U.S. The Chinese government has asked four large AI-oriented firms in China \u2014 Baidu BIDU, -0.04% Tencent 0700, +1.75% TCEHY, -0.13% Alibaba BABA, +0.44% and iFlytek 002230, -0.66%  \u2014 to develop AI hardware and software systems to handle autonomous driving and language processing, so other companies could build on those skills.China may have also surpassed the American historic advantage in venture capital investments. In 2018, U.S. AI startups received $9.3 billion in venture funding \u2014 a record amount, but the number of deals was down from 2017. However, one report from China suggests that in the first half of 2018, Chinese venture investments \u2014 many of which involved AI \u2014 were higher than in the U.S. Data from 2017 suggest that Chinese AI firms received more venture funding than U.S. companies, although the American funding went to many more firms.There are other factors than investment that determine a country\u2019s long-term competitiveness on AI. Talent is an important one. The U.S. had a historical edge in this regard, with strong technical universities, many technology sector employers and relatively open immigration policies.A recent analysis of LinkedIn data suggests the U.S. has far more AI engineers than China does. But China is closing the gap rapidly, with a variety of education and training programs beginning as early as elementary school. The Trump administration\u2019s restrictions on immigration are encouraging some of the world\u2019s best AI researchers to stay home, rather than come to the U.S.Read: Telemigrants are coming for your white-collar job, and a wall won\u2019t stop themAnother element in long-term AI success is how particular regions build mutually reinforcing communities of companies, university ecosystems and government agencies. Silicon Valley is the world leader in this regard, and China doesn\u2019t have anything to match it yet. Both the U.S. and China could learn from efforts in Canada, such as the work by the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, which has offered companies access to facilities, venture capital and university research partnerships to accelerate AI development in that city.A final key element in AI progress is data: The more data a country\u2019s companies have, the better able they are to develop capable AI systems. Chinese online firms have massive amounts of consumer data on which to train machine learning algorithms. Because of its very large number of inhabitants, the population\u2019s heavy use of digital services and its lax regulatory environment, China clearly beats the U.S. on data.I still think the U.S. has the edge over China in AI capabilities at the moment. However, as much as I would like the U.S. to win this race over the long run, if I were a betting man I would bet on China. As I describe in my new book \u201cThe AI Advantage,\u201d China is executing its strategy for AI, and the U.S. is still wrestling to create one. China is also reaping the benefits of having a determined government, an inexhaustible pot of money, a growing cadre of smart researchers and a large, digital-hungry population.Perhaps if the leadership of the U.S. government devoted as much attention and investment to AI as it does to its other strong priorities, the U.S. could maintain its lead in the field. That seems unlikely over the next couple of years, however.Thomas H. Davenport is a professor of information technology and management at Babson College and the author of \u201cThe AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work.\u201d This was first published by The Conversation \u2014 \u201cChina is catching up to the US on artificial intelligence research.\u201dWant news about Asia delivered to your inbox?

On Thursday, a report by the New York Times\u2019 Nellie Bowles laid out what may be coming, boiled down to two words: \u201cHousing madness.\u201dSan Francisco-based tech unicorns planning to go public in the near future include Uber Technologies, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb. While the San Francisco Bay Area has been no stranger to tech IPO riches in recent years, as Bowles pointed out, previous big tech IPOs \u2014 think Google and Facebook \u2014 have been largely based outside San Francisco and had workers spread out around the area. This new crop are based in the city itself, and many of their employees live there as well \u2014 or want to.Real estate agents are already drooling. According to the Times, at a recent gathering, one agent said there likely won\u2019t be any one-bedroom condos in San Francisco under $1 million within five years. And single-family homes, which already average well over $1 million, will reach an average of around $5 million, he forecast.Millennial tech workers want the convenience of the city, another real-estate agent told the Times: \u201cThey seem to not want to own cars, and food deliveries are really easy now, and they want to be close to entertainment, so they\u2019ll stay in the city.\u201dThat could be bad news for non-millionaires who are trying to find an affordable apartment or \u2014 gasp! \u2014 even a house. Displacement is likely to increase as housing prices become even more out of reach for lower- and middle-class people. The median price of a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco recently hit a new high of $3,690 a month, according to real-estate website Zumper, up 9% from the same time last year. That\u2019s more than $800 higher than the median New York City apartment.But while San Francisco\u2019s inequality gap may grow, some small businesses are poised to cash in. Event planners told the Times that the upcoming IPO boom will likely surpass the \u201890s tech bubble in terms of sheer excess \u2014 which is good news for them. One told the Times that party budgets for tech companies can top $10 million, with A-list entertainment. One recent tech exec\u2019s \u201880s-themed party featured the B-52s, Devo, The Bangles, Tears for Fears and A Flock of Seagulls, the planner said.At least one electric bike shop is stocking up its inventory, predicting a sales boom later in the year, and a nearby ice sculptor is gearing up for a big year, likely carving everything from massive ice sculptures to ice cubes with company logos engraved in them.The size of the coming boom is no sure thing \u2014 IPO bubbles have a nasty tendency to pop, as employees of companies such as Snap SNAP, -1.26%   and Blue Apron APRN, -1.02%   can attest to. Employees\u2019 stock options will be locked up for months after the companies go public, and it\u2019s unlikely most will entirely cash out at once. Still, there will likely be a noticeable effect.The growing financial excess has some talking about the certain backlash.\u201cThere\u2019s some who\u2019ve talked about pitchforks,\u201d a private wealth adviser told the Times. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go there, but there\u2019s a point when that makes sense.\u201d", "title": "Here\u2019s why San Francisco housing prices could soon get even crazier"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gillette-and-twitch-announce-the-gillette-gaming-alliance-2019-03-06": {"article": "Gillette PG, +0.61% the world\u2019s leading expert in men\u2019s grooming, and Twitch, the leading service and community for multiplayer entertainment, today announced the \u201cGillette Gaming Alliance,\u201d a team of 11 Twitch streamers from 11 countries selected to represent the brand and create content for viewers.

ARNC, -0.05%The purpose of the exercise, in part, is to give investors a sense of where crowded trades may be located as well as how positioning has evolved. The analysts note that \u201ccrowded names among active managers, including hedge funds, are usually crowded for a reason (good fundamentals)\u201d and that most of RBC\u2019s baskets of crowded names have outperformed since they started tracking data at the end of 2010.At the same time, positioning is a risk factor worth monitoring, they said, as the unwind of crowded positions can be quite painful when they occur.The chart below takes a look at how the so-called Hot Dogs and the Hotels performed in 2018 and early this year.

I\u2019m not a wealthy guy, but I am pretty blessed. I have my military pension of $45,000 annually, savings of $370,000, I own my home valued by Zillow Z, -1.62%  at $300,000 and it\u2019s mortgage-free. I have little to no health-care costs because I am 65, I have Medicare and Tricare for Life, and I have a long-term care policy in place. Oh, I also have zero debt because I rarely use my one credit card and pay off the balance each month.That said, I can\u2019t help but worry about money. I don\u2019t consider myself a spend thrift and have charitable donations between 10% and 15% each year. Most people would laugh to be in my position, I know, but I constantly worry about running out of money. My brother says it\u2019s because our parents had the \u201cDepression mentality.\u201d I do know that mom and dad always taught us to save something from each paycheck and to plan for the rainy day.Now, here I am at 65 and ready to finally retire and I\u2019m scared that I will become penniless. Please, any thoughts to help ease my mind?Scared of being pennilessDear Scared,You\u2019ve been on red alert your whole life. It\u2019s served you well. But there\u2019s no point in paying off your mortgage and saving a healthy six-figure sum, retiring and having medical coverage, if you can\u2019t sit back and enjoy it at the age of 65. Sometimes, it\u2019s good to write things down. Buy a little black book or set up a special folder on your computer so you can see all of your achievements, goals, income and expenditure in black and white. That may also provide a place for you to store your anxieties or, even better, exorcise them. Writing is cathartic and being able to clearly access and mull over your finances should help you relax.Enlist a financial adviser or, better yet, a financial therapist. The Financial Therapy Association takes a holistic approach to managing personal finances, including your history, anxieties, relationships past and present, and your emotional life. Financial therapists understand that most good and bad financial decisions are also emotional ones. One obvious example: Fear and uncertainty can cause stocks to fall and, during the Great Recession, many people bought high and sold low. With hindsight, after a 10-year bull market, that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense.Recommended: The next time you go anywhere, remember the $1 tip is deadNearly one quarter (23%) of people say a lack of emergency savings is the one financial issue that keeps them up at night. You don\u2019t have that problem. Some 22% say they don\u2019t have enough retirement savings. You don\u2019t have that issue either. Another 20% fear they\u2019ll be the victim of some kind of fraud. Forewarned is forearmed. Approximately 19% worry about losing their job. You\u2019re retired. Finally, 9% fret about losing their health insurance and 7% say poor credit keep them awake. You\u2019ve planned ahead regarding your health insurance and you\u2019ve no need to take out any loans.Also see: My boyfriend and I have two kids \u2014 should I pay off his $130,000 student debt?Here are some suggestions from the Moneyist Facebook Group, some of whom said they shared the same feelings of financial anxiety with you. \u201cTransitioning into retirement and from a savings-based financial mind set to spending is difficult and may take several years to get comfortable,\u201d one member wrote. He also said you should list your fears and face them head on. They often add up to a phantom menace. Another suggested focusing on a hobby, sport or even hill-walking, something that gets you outside and looking up at the sky. Exercise has proven to be good for anxiety. Other readers suggest a part-time job to keep your busy.Pick one thing per day that you have to be grateful for and, when you wake up every morning, thank the Universe for everything you have.

In the United States, in particular, inequality is at its highest since 1928, and economic growth remains woefully tepid compared to the decades after World War II.After promising annual growth of \u201c4, 5, and even 6%,\u201d President Donald Trump and his congressional Republican enablers have delivered only unprecedented deficits. According to the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s latest projections, the federal budget deficit will reach $900 billion this year, and will surpass the $1 trillion mark every year after 2021.And yet, the sugar high induced by the latest deficit increase is already fading, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting U.S. growth of 2.5% in 2019 and 1.8% in 2020, down from 2.9% in 2018.Many factors are contributing to the U.S. economy\u2019s low-growth/high-inequality problem.Trump and the Republicans\u2019 poorly designed tax \u201creform\u201d has exacerbated existing deficiencies in the tax code, funneling even more income to the highest earners. At the same time, globalization continues to be poorly managed, and financial markets continue to be geared toward extracting profits (rent-seeking, in economists\u2019 parlance), rather than providing useful services.But an even deeper and more fundamental problem is the growing concentration of market power, which allows dominant firms to exploit their customers and squeeze their employees, whose own bargaining power and legal protections are being weakened. CEOs and senior executives are increasingly extracting higher pay for themselves at the expense of workers and investment.For example, U.S. corporate executives made sure that the vast majority of the benefits from the tax cut went into dividends and stock buybacks, which exceeded a record-breaking $1.1 trillion in 2018. Buybacks raised share prices and boosted the earnings-per-share ratio, on which many executives\u2019 compensation is based.Meanwhile, at 13.7% of gross domestic product, fixed investment remained weak, while many corporate pensions went underfunded.Evidence of rising market power can be found almost anywhere one looks. Large markups are contributing to high corporate profits. In sector after sector, from little things like cat food to big things like telecoms, cable providers, airlines, and technology platforms, a few firms now dominate 75% to 90% of the market, if not more; and the problem is even more pronounced at the level of local markets.As corporate behemoths\u2019 market power has increased, so, too, has their ability to influence America\u2019s money-driven politics. And as the system has become more rigged in business\u2019s favor, it has become much harder for ordinary citizens to seek redress for mistreatment or abuse.A perfect example of this is the spread of arbitration clauses in labor contracts and user agreements, which allow corporations to settle disputes with employees and customers through a sympathetic mediator, rather than in court.Multiple forces are driving the increase in market power.One is the growth of sectors with large network effects, where a single firm \u2014 like Google GOOG, +1.89%   or Facebook FB, +0.02%  \u2014 can easily dominate. Another is the prevailing attitude among business leaders, who have come to assume that market power is the only way to ensure durable profits.As the venture capitalist Peter Thiel famously put it, \u201ccompetition is for losers.\u201dSome business leaders have shown real ingenuity in creating market barriers to prevent any kind of meaningful competition, aided by lax enforcement of existing competition laws and the failure to update those laws for the 21st-century economy.As a result, the share of new firms in the U.S. is declining.None of this bodes well for the U.S. economy. Rising inequality implies falling aggregate demand, because those at the top of the wealth distribution tend to consume a smaller share of their income than those of more modest means.Moreover, on the supply side, market power weakens incentives to invest and innovate. Firms know that if they produce more, they will have to lower their prices. This is why investment remains weak, despite corporate America\u2019s record profits and trillions of dollars of cash reserves.And besides, why bother producing anything of value when you can use your political power to extract more rents through market exploitation? Political investments in getting lower taxes yield far higher returns than real investments in plant and equipment.Making matters worse, America\u2019s low tax-to-GDP ratio \u2014 just 27.1% even before the Trump tax cut \u2014 means a dearth of money for investment in the infrastructure, education, health care, and basic research needed to ensure future growth. These are the supply-side measures that actually do \u201ctrickle down\u201d to everyone.The policies for combating economically damaging power imbalances are straightforward.Over the past half-century, Chicago School economists, acting on the assumption that markets are generally competitive, narrowed the focus of competition policy solely to economic efficiency, rather than broader concerns about power and inequality.The irony is that this assumption became dominant in policy making circles just when economists were beginning to reveal its flaws. The development of game theory and new models of imperfect and asymmetric information laid bare the profound limitations of the competition model.The law needs to catch up. Anti-competitive practices should be illegal, period.And beyond that, there are a host of other changes needed to modernize U.S. antitrust legislation. Americans need the same resolve in fighting for competition that their corporations have shown in fighting against it.The challenge, as always, is political. But with U.S. corporations having amassed so much power, there is reason to doubt that the American political system is up to the task of reform. Add to that the globalization of corporate power and the orgy of deregulation and crony capitalism under Trump, and it is clear that Europe will have to take the lead.This article was published with permission of Project Syndicate \u2014 Market Concentration Is Threatening the US Economy.", "title": "Opinion: Growing market power of a few corporate behemoths is stunting the economy"}, "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/looming-recession-inspires-silicon-valley-innovator-to-open-source-tools-and-strategies-to-drive-growth-2019-03-05": {"article": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 5, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- West Stringfellow, who led major innovation and new product development initiatives at Amazon, PayPal, Target, Visa and Rosetta Stone, has launched an open-source website to help American businesses grow in the face of the looming recession.Explore the resource here: https://we.st/research/According to the recently released survey from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), 10% of economists see a recession occurring this year, 42% see a recession in 2020, and 25% believe it will happen in 2021. \"There is a reason analysts suggested holding FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) stocks through the last recession,\" says West. \"Our research exposes how the FAANG companies use data, strategies and tools to drive long-term growth, even during recessions.\"West and his team spent 15,000 hours diving into academic journals, company case studies, and classic business literature to produce actionable solutions for long-term growth.

Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, the following: that Whole Foods and other natural food chains are a significant part of the Company's sales growth strategy for our 2020 Fiscal Year; and that the Company expects to be in all Whole Foods stores by the end of its 2020 Fiscal Year.The material assumptions supporting these forward-looking statements include, among others, that the demand for the Company's products will continue to significantly grow; that the past production capacity of the Company's co-packing facilities can be maintained or increased; that the Company will receive all necessary regulatory approvals for the production and sale of hemp-infused water that there will be increased production capacity through implementation of new production facilities, new co-packers and new technology; that there will be an increase in number of products available for sale to retailers and consumers; that there will be an expansion in geographical areas by national retailers carrying the Company's products; that there will be an expansion into new national and regional grocery retailers; that there will not be interruptions on production of the Company's products; that there will not be a recall of products due to unintended contamination or other adverse events relating to the Company's products; and that the Company will be able to obtain additional capital to meet the Company's growing demand and satisfy the capital expenditure requirements needed to increase production and support sales activity. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to numerous factors. Such factors include, among others, governmental regulations being implemented regarding the production and sale of alkaline water or any other products, including products containing hemp; the fact that consumers may not embrace and purchase any of the Company's infused water products; the fact that the Company may not be permitted by the FDA or other regulatory authority to market or sell any of its hemp-infused products; additional competitors selling alkaline water and enhanced water products in bulk containers reducing the Company's sales; the fact that the Company does not own or operate any of its production facilities and that co-packers may not renew current agreements and/or not satisfy increased production quotas; that fact that the Company has a limited number of suppliers of its unique bulk bottles; the potential for supply chain interruption due to factors beyond the Company's control; the fact that there may be a recall of products due to unintended contamination; the inherent uncertainties associated with operating as an early stage company; changes in customer demand and the fact consumers may not embrace enhanced water products as expected or at all; the extent to which the Company is successful in gaining new long-term relationships with new retailers and retaining existing relationships with retailers; the Company's ability to raise the additional funding that it will need to continue to pursue its business, planned capital expansion and sales activity; and competition in the industry in which the Company operates and market conditions. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release, and the Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and Canada.

An unintended consequence is that some investors have learned the wrong lessons during that time.For prudent investors, the 10th anniversary of the bull is a time to pause, set aside biases and opinions, shift into neutral and carefully read this article. Let\u2019s explore with the help of four charts.Please click here for a chart of the ETF SPY, +0.44%  which represents the S&P 500 SPX, +0.40%Please click here for a chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.34% from the 1960s to the 1980s.Please click here for a chart of the Dow Jones Industrial Average from the early 1900s to the mid-1900s.Please click here for a chart of Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 Index NIK, +1.79% Please note the following:\u2022 The second and third charts show that there have been periods in the U.S. stock market when, depending on your starting point, passive investing would have not done well.\u2022 The fourth chart shows if you were passively investing in Japan over 25 years ago, you would still be underwater.\u2022 The first chart shows that The Arora Report gave a signal to aggressively buy stocks in March 2009, which turned out to be the start of this secular bull market.\u2022 The chart shows that this has been a secular bull market with very few cyclical corrections that approached a bear market.\u2022 The chart shows that volatility has been low compared to other periods.\u2022 The chart shows that investors more than quadrupled their money from the low in 2009.Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora.The human condition as it is, most of us suffer from recency bias. That means people remember what has happened recently at the exclusion of the past. In other words, investors erroneously believe what has happened recently will happen in the future.Do you really know with certainty that the next decade or two will be similar to the past decade or two?Investors are constantly bombarded with touted data, such as:\u2022 The average return over the past 100 years has been absolutely fantastic. Do you have 100 years to live?\u2022 The average return over the past 10 years has been great.\u2022 The stock market has never lost money over a certain period of time.Take a second look at the charts linked above; you will readily see the data that is touted is misleading in many respects. By accepting it, you are saying that you know that the next 10 to 50 years will be similar to the past 10 to 50 years.Should you drive by looking through the rearview mirror or should you be looking forward?A large number of investors are oblivious to the debt bubble not only in the U.S. but across the world. Here are some of the lessons that many investors appear to have learned.\u2022 All one has to do is invest money in the stock market and profits arrive.\u2022 Markets owe investors good returns just because they invest money.\u2022 Volatility is not a problem. Yes, markets go down a little, but then they go up more.\u2022 Dips in stock prices should be bought.\u2022 You can quadruple your money in about 10 years. Even if the market is not that good going forward, investors will earn 8% to 12% per year.Those lessons are highly flawed when one looks at the charts linked above.A way to avoid recency bias is to stick to a strategy. The strategy we use at the Arora Report combines elements of \u201cbuy and hold\u201d and \u201cmarket timing.\u201d Our strategy has been consistent for a long time. Until 2015, we used to get complaints from some investors that our strategy had too much \u201cbuy and hold.\u201d Since 2017, we get complaints that our strategy has too much market timing. Still, we performed well over both periods.Remember that between the two periods, our strategy has not changed \u2014 it is the recency bias on display. Up to 2015, investors hated \u201cbuy and hold\u201d because of losses that strategy incurred amid the financial meltdown in 2008.By 2017, investors had forgotten 2008 losses. Market timing is now hated and \u201cbuy and hold\u201d is in favor.There were times when General Electric GE, -1.11% and IBM IBM, +0.73% were the most popular stocks. Investors who stuck with General Electric have lost a lot of money in the bull market.Do you really know that today\u2019s popular stocks, such as Apple AAPL, +1.06% Amazon AMZN, +0.64% and Facebook FB, +0.22% will continue to perform well over the next decade? Do you really know that the strategies being pursued by companies such as high-fliers Micron Technology MU, +0.53% AMD AMD, +2.24%  and Salesforce CRM, +0.84% will be in vogue a decade from now? Popular health insurers such as Anthem ANTM, -0.06% UnitedHealth UNH, +0.86% and Cigna CI, +0.98% may not even exist in their current forms if \u201cMedicare for all\u201d becomes a reality.Since there is a high probability that the U.S. mega-cap stocks that dominate the indexes may underperform, there is merit to looking at countries such as India and China. Alibaba BABA, +0.45% and JD.com JD, +2.26% come to mind as examples.On pullbacks, investors may want to look at ETFs such as Mainland China ETF ASHR, +0.39% China internet ETF KWEB, -0.77% India ETF EPI, +0.39% and emerging-market ETF EEM, +0.65%There\u2019s also merit in reviewing gold ETF GLD, +0.32% silver ETF SLV, +0.45% and precious miner ETF GDX, +0.72%Investors ought to think in terms of probabilities. Once you accept the premise that you do not know with close to 100% probability how the next decade will turn out, you will see the merit of developing more skills and knowledge about the markets and expending your horizons to emerging markets and commodities.The message is to continue to invest but think differently. Simply putting money in an S&P 500 fund is not likely to be rewarding compared to active investing. \u201cBuy and hold\u201d may have significant pitfalls in the future. Going forward there will be an abundance of investing and trading opportunities \u2014 it will likely take a different skill set to be successful.Consider paying attention to Arora\u2019s Fourth Law of Investing: The markets owe you nothing. It is your job to extract money out of the markets.Disclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.

Gross margins, excluding fuel are still under pressure, 2019 same-store sales guidance is below forecasts even as the three-year transformation plan Restock Kroger matures, they wrote.\u201cThat said, the selloff looks overdone, in our view, implying a ~6x multiple on our 2019 EBITDA estimate at $25,\u201d said the note. The recent talk that Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.66%  is looking to launch a supermarket chain has likely added to the downdraft, said the analysts.On the company\u2019s earnings call, Chief Executive W. Rodney McMullen acknowledged the stock move, saying \u201cthe team here at Kroger realizes that we have our work cut out for us, as the market points out this morning.\u201cWe realize business transformations are hard but I want to emphasize we are on track to deliver on our Restock Kroger commitments,\u201d he said.Kroger reported net income of $259 million, or 32 cents a share, in the quarter to Feb. 2, down from $854 million, or 96 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted net earnings came to 48 cents a share, below the 52 cents FactSet consensus.See also: Amazon\u2019s $15 minimum wage could put pressure on other retailers to raise paySales fell 9.5% to $28.1 billion, also below the FactSet consensus of $28.4 billion. Gross margins excluding fuel fell by 93 basis points, mostly due to investments in the supply chain and to keep prices low. Costs rose as the company paid more in bonuses and staffed digital initiatives.The company said it\u2019s expecting fiscal 2019 EPS of $2.15 to $2.25, which compares with a FactSet consensus of $2.25.Don\u2019t miss: Analyst worries that Kroger comment will lead the grocer down the same path as SearsRelated: Good news if you buy organic food \u2014 it\u2019s getting cheaperKroger has been beefing up its online presence as the overall grocery sector braces for an increase in e-commerce following Amazon\u2019s entry to the business through its acquisition of Whole Foods. The company has also been seeking to diversify revenue streams by expanding into areas including financial services and by tracking and selling customer data. The company said it\u2019s on track to meet a goal of generating $400 million in operating profit by next year, although analysts on its earnings call sounded skeptical.Read also: Why Walmart\u2019s online push will be a money machine for investors\u201cWhile we are disappointed in the margin erosion for the quarter, the digital growth of 58% and ex-fuel same-store sales growth of 1.9% for the quarter are encouraging considering the intense competition for market share throughout the industry,\u201d said Moody\u2019s analyst and vice president Mickey Chadha.\u201cAlso impressive is Kroger\u2019s private label penetration with unit sales of Kroger\u2019s own brands now over 30%. These brands not only have a much higher margin but also build loyalty with customers as they cannot find them elsewhere.\u201dKroger shares have fallen 1.5% in the last 12 months, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, +0.13%  has fallen 1.8%.

They\u2019re making appearances in beauty products, too. Think all things green \u2014 spirulina, avocado, green tea, matcha, kale \u2014 in face masks, body care and hair care. Functional mushrooms, which made Whole Foods Market\u2019s food trends predictions list in 2018 for their growing presence in food and beverage aisles, are becoming more familiar to consumers, making them another superfood to watch for in topical beauty products like lotions and cosmetics. Beauty brands like Cocokind include functional mushroom powders from reishi, maitake and chaga mushrooms as ingredients in their bronze, rose and gold-hued shimmery highlighters. Body care brands like Alaffia are blending reishi with coconut and vanilla in several products including their nourishing hand body cream.Try the trend: Whole Foods Market Soothing Avocado Cotton Cupra Facial Sheet Mask; Acure Brightening Super Greens Serum, Cocokind Mushroom-Charged Highlighters (Sunrei, Chagaglo, Mai-light); Not Your Mother\u2019s Naturals Matcha Green Tea & Wild Apple Blossom Shampoo, Conditioner and Masque; Alaffia Coconut Vanilla Reishi Hand and Body CreamBeauty from WithinThe beauty-oriented supplements category is booming with new products (and new ways to ingest them) geared toward consumers looking for healthier hair, skin and nails. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are being highlighted in the beauty world more than ever, in addition to other star ingredients, including collagen, which can now be found in powders, chews and shots. You can even find this hot ingredient in many Whole Foods Market coffee bars, where customers can order a collagen add-in to blended coffee drinks. Several brands of plant-based protein powder blends are also promoting beauty from within, with brands like Amazing Grass and their Amazing Protein Glow Chocolate Rose Powder. Cheers to convenience and options!Try the trend: Ancient Nutrition Ancient Probiotics Skin; Amazing Grass Chocolate Rose Amazing Protein Glow; Vital Proteins Glow Beauty Collagen Shot; Reserveage Orange Berry Twist Lipid Beauty Complex; Ancient Nutrition Beauty Within Multi-Collagen Protein; Whole Foods Market Collagen + C TabletsVegan CosmeticsWhile Whole Foods Market has only sold beauty and personal care products that have not been tested on animals for more than 30 years, the cruelty-free movement is picking up steam across the industry in 2019 with an emergence of (and customer demand for) new vegan cosmetics. Due to increased consumer awareness around transparency, vegan and non-vegan customers alike are also paying attention to third-party certifications like Leaping Bunny. Another factor leading this trend is the improved pigments and staying power of vegan cosmetics rivaling those of conventional makeup brands. With brands like W3ll People, Pacifica and Au Naturale offering more vibrant colors and pigments than ever before, Whole Foods Market\u2019s Whole Body department continues to see a steady increase of vegan cosmetics entering the space.Try the trend: Pacifica Stellar Gaze Supernova Mascara; Pacifica Jet Black Eye Pencil, W3ll People Bio Baked Bronzer Powder; Au Naturale Eternity Sangria Lipstick; Au Naturale The OG All-Glowing Creme HighlighterSleep SupportersThe term \u201cbeauty sleep\u201d isn\u2019t a new idea, but in 2019, consumers are approaching it in a more holistic way. Nighttime rituals are gaining popularity in homes (and being widely shared on Instagram) whether it\u2019s making a soothing beverage, taking a bath or relaxing with a face mask at the end of the day. With an array of products from aromatherapy essential oil blends and diffusers to bath bombs and sleep-supporting supplements, there are more ways than ever to create a personalized evening beauty routine geared toward the best rest. Warming beverages like #moonmilk and golden milk incorporate adaptogens that have been used for centuries in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicines to support sleep and decrease the effects of stress.
