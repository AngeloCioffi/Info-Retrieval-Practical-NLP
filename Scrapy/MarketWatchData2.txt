But Maimone, whose union represents close to 9,000 Department of Defense employees worldwide, said it felt like higher-ups were \u201cpicking on\u201d employees who are invested in marijuana-related stocks.\u201cCannabis is not a problem in this country,\u201d Maimone said. \u201cWe have more of a problem with substance abuse, yet they\u2019re not going after people who own stock in companies that make opioids.\u201d Employees in his union typically make about $80,000 a year, and the employee who ran afoul of clearance rules had a few hundred dollars invested in cannabis companies, he said.Investing in cannabis-related companies kicked into high gear last year when Canada legalized recreational marijuana use, but the question of how it affects federal security clearances got renewed attention this month after a memo reportedly authored by DoD lawyers circulated on Facebook FB, +1.99%   and Reddit.The memo said that U.S. Air Force officials had \u201creceived numerous inquiries regarding the purchase of marijuana related stocks.\u201d It went on to explain that the Pentagon \u201ctreats investments in marijuana-related companies as \u2018involvement,\u2019 [in drugs] which is prohibited.\u201dIt added, \u201cOwning marijuana-related stocks is a reportable incident\u201d and DoD authorities \u201cwill determine if the \u2018involvement\u2019 raises questions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, including federal laws.\u201dBut a Department of Defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the memo is just one attorney\u2019s opinion, and does not represent the Pentagon\u2019s official stance.In fact, there is no set DoD policy on ownership of marijuana stocks, and recent news reports on the issue have \u201cincorrectly cited\u201d a policy change, a DoD spokeswoman told MarketWatch.\u201cWhile, currently, no official DoD guidance specific to financial involvement in marijuana exists, the Department continues to research the topic,\u201d said spokeswoman Lt. Col. Audricia M. Harris. \u201cAny changes will be addressed through normal policy update procedures.\u201d She added that security clearance investigators use what\u2019s called the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d when deciding whether to grant clearance. In other words, there are a number of factors that influence the decision.The questions come as the burgeoning cannabis industry is capturing the interest of investors who see an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially lucrative market. Shares in companies like, Aphria Inc. APHA, +1.52%  , Aurora Cannabis Inc. ACB, +3.27%  , Cronos Group Inc., Canopy Growth Corp CGC, +0.86% WEED, +1.65%  , GW Pharmaceuticals GWPH, +3.10%  , and Tilray Inc. TLRY, -1.06%  have surged over the last year.See also: A guide to pot stocks: What you need to know to invest in cannabis companiesMeanwhile, the clash between state and federal laws has created unique legal questions. Canadian cannabis investors who visit the U.S. run the risk of a lifetime ban by border officials, and people who work at cannabis businesses in states where it\u2019s legal were advised to seek lawyers after the Trump administration rescinded an Obama-era marijuana enforcement policy.And Elon Musk, whose SpaceX does business with the federal government, has been under scrutiny since smoking marijuana during a podcast last fall, though initial reports that his security clearance was under review were later debunked. (SpaceX declined to comment on Bloomberg\u2019s most recent report of a security review.)Employees at the more than 30 federal agencies that require security clearances are similarly caught in the conflicting legal landscape. Anthony Kuhn, an attorney who represents people seeking security clearance, says even though there\u2019s no formal Pentagon policy prohibiting marijuana investments, he would advise clients against it.Ironically, he noted, anyone whose 401(k) includes an S&P 500 SPX, +0.93%   index fund \u2014 including federal employees who save money in the government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan \u2014 is probably already invested indirectly in the industry. S&P company Altria MO, +0.81%  , the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, owns a major stake in cannabis company Cronos CRON, -3.86%  , for example. Kuhn doesn\u2019t think owning index fund shares would represent much of a threat to someone\u2019s security clearance.But buying shares in individual cannabis companies is another matter. \u201cIf you are purposely seeking out marijuana stocks and intentionally investing in what the federal government sees as an illegal drug, you run the risk of losing your clearance,\u201d said Kuhn, who chairs the national security practice group at law firm Tully & Rinckey.He represents people seeking clearance for jobs with a range of government agencies, either so they can work as full-time employees at places like the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement Agency, or as subcontractors. As of 2015, some 4.3 million people in the U.S. had security clearance, according to a Congressional Research Service Report.Bill Henderson, a Leesburg, Va.-based consultant at FEDCAS, a company that helps employees navigate the clearance process, said investing in cannabis companies probably doesn\u2019t fall into the Pentagon\u2019s definition of involvement in illegal drugs. In his view, that prohibition only applies to using, buying, selling, cultivating and trafficking in drugs \u2014 not investing in them.In his experience, there\u2019s another type of investment that\u2019s much more likely to trip up security clearance applicants.\u201cThey\u2019re not too enthusiastic about ownership of foreign stocks,\u201d Henderson told MarketWatch. \u201cIn the last 10 years, foreign influence has become the second leading reason for clearance denial.\u201dAnd the No. 1 factor that stands in the way of obtaining security clearances? Financial issues including delinquent debt, failure to pay taxes, or gambling, said Henderson. People with unsound finances are considered security risks because they\u2019re vulnerable to being tempted with payoffs from enemies of the U.S., he noted.\u201cHistorically, money has been the No. 1 reason for Americans to betray their country,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cWhen we spy against other countries, they tend to be motivated by ideology. But we tend to motivated by money.\u201dGet a daily roundup of the top reads in personal finance delivered to your inbox. Subscribe to MarketWatch's free Personal Finance Daily newsletter.
